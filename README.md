## Background

### What Is This Repo?

On [July 11, 2019](https://github.com/p1m-ortho/qs-global-ortho-search-queries/commit/70d3bebf1ed70845950aece09122b49f58fe2880), I inititated this study with the aim of creating an exhaustive registry of systematic reviews in orthopedics (in Russian). Due to the large volume of records to screen, it was not very successful; however, it still did continue up until [Feb 17, 2020](https://github.com/p1m-ortho/qs-global-ortho-search-queries/commit/d44e7db892a23adb8ca3eeb36cbe55b8e05b7b45), when it went into a 200-day hiatus.

Since [September 6, 2020](https://github.com/p1m-ortho/qs-global-ortho-search-queries/commit/ff1f29c87483b355b9541859d4b4c39052046936), the study has continued as [![Woodpecker by Anton from The Noun Project](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/drzhelnov/zheln.github.io/gh-pages/favicons/favicon-16x16.png)](https://zheln.com) [Zheln.com](https://zheln.com), a crowdfunding project, and this repository has been a chosen methods repo, while the website itself is hosted in a [separate Zheln repo](https://github.com/drzhelnov/zheln.github.io).

### What Has Changed as Zheln?

1. The focus of the study has been widened to include not only orthopedics but any evidence-based practice.
2. Critical appraisal and replication of reviews is now also performed as part of this project.
3. Grouping of appraised systematic reviews by health care specialty has been recognized as a critical part of the project.

The search & screening methods have not basically changed, whereas the methods of critical appraisal may be described in one phrase: Informal study of the review documentation with replication of some of the elements of the review by a single appraiser to formulate their expert impression as to whether the review is reproducible and whether it is useful for evidence-based practice.

Crowdfunding details are available from the [Zheln](https://zheln.com) website.

### Who Am I & Why Zheln?

Please refer to the [Zheln main repo README](https://github.com/drzhelnov/zheln.github.io/blob/gh-pages/README.md).

## Zheln‚Äôs Mission

> Every systematic review daily added to PubMed will get a rigorous, independent, and open-access critical appraisal.

## Objectives

1. Monitor most of all published systematic reviews to rapidly identify new systematic reviews. Systematic reviews, in their turn, are known to be, today, the best source of information for evidence-based practice.
2. Critically appraise and, where possible, replicate those of the systematic reviews identified that are useful for evidence-based practice, in the appraiser‚Äôs mind.
3. Tag the records under review with physician specialties to ease following the updates by practising physicians.

**Pragmatic worth:**

* Early disseminate findings of well-conducted systematic reviews with large practice impact to general English-speaking audience.
* Early disseminate new systematic review records to practising physicians according to their specialty.
* Provide both the general audience and practising physicians, who usually lack expertise in evidence synthesis, with open-access quality critical appraisals of systematic reviews.

## Methods

### The Ten Steps

For clarity, I summarized the methods as **Zheln Review Appraisal in 10 Steps.** They are shipped in two versions: _Explanatory_ and _Pragmatic._ The former sheds light on what Zheln appraisal is about, whereas the latter guides how it‚Äôs actually done. Throughout Zheln, if simply a _Step_ is mentioned, usually it is safe to assume an Explanatory Step.

### _Ten Explanatory Steps_

1. [‚ÑπÔ∏è](#pubmed-search) Downloaded from the PubMed Systematic Subset Daily Updates 
2. [‚ÑπÔ∏è](#record-screening) Meets [Shojania & Bero 2001](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/11820967_Taking_Advantage_of_the_Explosion_of_Systematic_Reviews_An_Efficient_MEDLINE_Search_Strategy) True Positive Criteria for Systematic Reviews by Either Title or Abstract?
3. [‚ÑπÔ∏è](#collection-of-reports) Full Text or Other Reports Collected by Zheln
4. [‚ÑπÔ∏è](#data-extraction) Generates Pragmatic Evidence Directly Relevant to Evidence-Based Practice?
5. [‚ÑπÔ∏è](#critical-appraisal) Is Duplicate?
6. [‚ÑπÔ∏è](#critical-appraisal) Passed or Failed Replication?
7. [‚ÑπÔ∏è](#critical-appraisal) Has Critical Conduct Flaws?
8. [‚ÑπÔ∏è](#critical-appraisal) Liked or Disliked by Zheln?
9. [‚ÑπÔ∏è](#data-synthesis) Practical Implications Summarized by Zheln
10. [‚ÑπÔ∏è](#publication) Appraisal Published & Call for Crowdfunding

Each step is also marked with an appraisal status icon:

* üîÑ Not Started or In Progress
* ‚ùå Failed Appraisal
* ‚úÖ Passed Appraisal 

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important!**
>
> * Methods to [specialty-tag](#specialty-tagging) are not included in the steps as there is no specific time point when tagging should be complete: It starts when the record review starts and it ends when the record review ends.
> * However, these methods are important and are, thus, summarized in this document.

### _Ten Pragmatic Steps_

> To conduct an appraisal, compiled editable versions of the records will be required. You can either take precompiled records from the [posts-edit](https://github.com/p1m-ortho/qs-global-ortho-search-queries/tree/global-sr-query/zheln/posts-edit) directory in this repository or [compile them yourself](#editable-version). When you are ready, here is the pathway of primary appraisal.

1. Open an MD file from the `posts-edit` directory with any plain-text editor that supports [GitHub-Flavored Markdown](https://github.github.com/gfm/) preview, like either [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) + [Markdown Preview Enhanced Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=shd101wyy.markdown-preview-enhanced) or [Epsilon Notes](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ekartoyev.enotes).
2. Look at the citation title and check it against [Zheln eligibility criteria](#record-screening) at [Explanatory Step 2](#record-screening). If it matches, check the `2. ‚úÖ Meets Shojania & Bero 2001 True Positive Criteria for Systematic Reviews by Title` checkbox.
3. Else click the PMID link to open the PubMed record page and inspect the abstract. If it matches, check the `2. ‚úÖ Meets Shojania & Bero 2001 True Positive Criteria for Systematic Reviews by Abstract` tick; else check `2. ‚ùå Does Not Meet Shojania & Bero 2001 True Positive Criteria for Systematic Reviews by Neither Title nor Abstract`.
4. If the abstract is needed to assess eligibility but is unavailable, do not go for locating the full text but assess based on the title alone instead. By contrast, abstract lookup at the publisher‚Äôs is sometimes warranted, usually when the article is a commentary; consider [PMID 32977958](https://pubmed.gov/32977958), to give you an idea. Also, please don‚Äôt use any information PubMed would load from _PubMed Central_ as any of it is not actually a part of the MEDLINE record.
5. After you‚Äôve assessed eligibility, unless you‚Äôd found the record to be ineligible, go for [specialty-tagging](#specialty-tagging). Else close the record, as its appraisal is finished.
6. To specialty-tag, use [specialty-tagging guidance](#specialty-tagging). In short, you tick at least one specialty tag in the specialty-tag list that best suits the record. Think about the specialty in which the specialists are likely to be most interested in this record. You normally use just the record abstract on PubMed to underpin these decisions. Also, if unsure about the scope of a specialty, you research it until comfortable. To reiterate, please use the [full guidance](#specialty-tagging) to actually specialty-tag.
7. Next, make a decision as to whether this record warrants a full appraisal regardless of crowdfunding. As a rule, it does when the topic covered is likely to have a universal or very large practice impact with regard either to both global health care workers and the public or to the minorities. In other words, Zheln does not include studies of narrow topics that likely are of interest to specialists only unless these appraisals are specifically crowdfunded. Essentially, these are the _**Zheln inclusion criteria.**_ The language of publication **must not** influence this decision. _Exclusion criteria:_ [COVID-19 publications are not selected](https://github.com/p1m-ortho/qs-global-ortho-search-queries/commit/b86bda0b75e1103991c3d57d22c03a9d49807905).
8. If you have selected the record for full appraisal, go to the very bottom of the record to find more checkboxes. Follow [Explanatory Steps 3 thru 9](#ten-explanatory-steps) and tick relevant checkboxes. Else, if you haven‚Äôt selected the record for immediate full appraisal and believe it‚Äôs narrow enough so that it‚Äôs perfectly fine for it to await crowdfunding, just proceed further.
9. Finally, when at [Explanatory Step 10](#publication), ensure you are ready to submit the record for final publication. If any additional appraisal work on the record is pending, just do not check this item.
10. The appraisal is now complete.

### PubMed Search

(aka **Explanatory Step 1**)

* See the [search queries in an Appendix](#appendix-pubmed-systematic-review-subset-query-zheln-edition).
* This _PubMed Systematic Review Subset Query, Zheln Edition,_ ultimately represents the [Search Strategy Used to Create the Systematic Reviews Subset on PubMed](https://www.nlm.nih.gov/bsd/pubmed_subsets/sysreviews_strategy.html) as joined from the two versions: [February 2017](http://web.archive.org/web/20181023065423/https://www.nlm.nih.gov/bsd/pubmed_subsets/sysreviews_strategy.html) and [December 2018](http://web.archive.org/web/20190711085949/https://www.nlm.nih.gov/bsd/pubmed_subsets/sysreviews_strategy.html).
* The February 2017 version is [based](https://wayback.archive-it.org/org-350/20180406175620/https://www.nlm.nih.gov/bsd/pubmed_subsets/sysreviews_sources.html) on the study by [Shojania & Bero 2001](https://pubmed.gov/11525102).
* I don‚Äôt know what the December 2018 version is based on, it‚Äôs not been written there.
* The _Zheln Edition_ exists in two versions: [Live](#live-version) & [Replicated](#replicated-version). The former is a regular search query that would produce all records available by the time of search, whereas the latter produces a consistent, replicable set of records for a certain date.
* See a detailed account of the development of the _Zheln Edition_ and its testing reports in the [commit history of the repository](https://github.com/p1m-ortho/qs-global-ortho-search-queries/commits/global-sr-query).
* While lurking through the commit history, be sure to inspect [both the diff _and_ the body of the commits](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Recording-Changes-to-the-Repository).
* On [Zheln](https://zheln.com), records that are at the Step 1 of the appraisal process are automatically (since the [version 2.2.1](https://github.com/p1m-ortho/qs-global-ortho-search-queries/commit/af6d75fa635c2d62169e9ec36505b9657a127ed9#diff-d556e85617be04293b0ad953ad7028b3) of the record-maker script) assigned the `awaiting appraisal` status tag. Also, the [corresponding footer](https://github.com/p1m-ortho/qs-global-ortho-search-queries/blob/global-sr-query/zheln/footer-1-true.txt) is attached and the records are sorted [at random](https://www.random.org/sequences/?mode=advanced) within their date.
* Adding other search sources, such as Scopus, PROSPERO, OSF, and medRxiv, is planned in the future when more appraisers become available.

### Record Screening

(aka **Explanatory Step 2**)

* This is the step where record eligibility for Zheln appraisal is assessed.
* As appraising all retrieved records turned out to be very resource-intensive, will probably appraise only random 10% of records at first (see the [randomization protocol](#editable-version)). When enough resources are available, all records will be appraised. Current information on this matter is available from the [latest Zheln summary posts](https://zheln.com).
* Record eligibility is assessed by checking the record title and, if the title failed, abstract against the ‚Äòtrue positive criteria‚Äô for systematic reviews taken from the publication by [Shojania & Bero 2001 (Open Access)](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/11820967_Taking_Advantage_of_the_Explosion_of_Systematic_Reviews_An_Efficient_MEDLINE_Search_Strategy) and extended further for Zheln (see below).
* This is a diagnostic test accuracy (DTA) assessment for the systematic review search strategy by the authors‚Äîthe very search strategy that the [PubMed Systematic Subset](#pubmed-search) was originally based on. Incidentally, this is the reason I chose these criteria for Zheln in the first place.
* I quote:
  
    > We regarded an article as a true positive only if the title or abstract explicitly identified the article as a systematic review or meta-analysis or if the article abstract indicated a strategy for locating the literature reviewed. Thus, an article that contained the phrase ‚Äúliterature review‚Äù in the title but merely stated that ‚Äúrelevant literature was reviewed‚Äù in the abstract would not count as a true positive. MEDLINE records without an abstract could be counted as true positives only if the title contained the words ‚Äúmeta-analysis,‚Äù ‚Äúmetaanalysis,‚Äù or ‚Äúsystematic review.‚Äù

* One important limitation of these criteria that became apparent during appraisals is their failure to comprehensively account for _practice guidelines,_ which are often informed by a systematic review.
* Also, it has become evident during the appraisal process that these criteria fail to capture other review types that make use of systematic methodology. See [PMID 33162676](https://pubmed.gov/33162676) that is a scoping review implementing systematic methodology but fails the original Shojania & Bero criteria. Also, see [PMID 33148320](https://pubmed.gov/33148320) that references an evidence synthesis with no explicit identification as a systematic review.
* I could have modified Shojania & Bero criteria to include these; however, that would require editing and likely retesting the search query to account for the changes, reappraising all records already appraised, and many other modifications. As I am not currently ready to engage into that, I will not modify the original criteria.
* Therefore, it is worth noting the Zheln‚Äôs screening strategy is inadequate to identify practice guidelines and the coupled systematic reviews whatsoever, so Zheln goes well for standalone-published systematic reviews only. Also, some reviews that follow other evidence-based methodologies, such as scoping or integrative reviews, are missed.
* That said, the rate Zheln misses such records at is currently unclear and requires pragmatic estimation. It would best be done along with estimating the fraction of published systematic reviews that PubMed missed.
* There are other special cases to be discussed.

    * Commentaries, reprints, and such related to an original systematic review are included as they reference a systematic review.
    * Meta-analyses outside the context of a systematic review (variants on _data pooling_) are included if they are explicitly termed meta-analyses as this is how the Shojania & Bero criteria are worded. So these are few false positives. See [PMID 33180528](https://pubmed.gov/33180528) for instance.
    * Protocols for systematic reviews are included as they reference a systematic review.
    * Studies nesting a systematic review are naturally included.

* Anyway, those records that do not meet these criteria are marked as **Failed Step 2** (see [this supplementary file](https://github.com/p1m-ortho/qs-global-ortho-search-queries/blob/global-sr-query/zheln/footer-edit.txt) for the current exact wording) and are not appraised further.
* Technically, screening entails _conversion_ of the citation list downloaded from PubMed in the `Summary (text)` format (see the [list of all original PubMed exports](https://github.com/p1m-ortho/qs-global-ortho-search-queries/tree/global-sr-query/zheln/summary-systematic-set) made by Zheln) into individual editable records with further _compilation_ of the edited records into their published versions that are available from [Zheln](https://zheln.com).
* To do both, I wrote from scratch a special [bash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_(Unix_shell)) script that I named [_General Makeposti_](https://github.com/p1m-ortho/qs-global-ortho-search-queries/blob/global-sr-query/zheln/general-makeposti.sh).
* For a look into how an editable record looks like, take any in the [directory of editable posts](https://github.com/p1m-ortho/qs-global-ortho-search-queries/tree/global-sr-query/zheln/posts-edit/). Alternatively, you could use _General Makeposti_ to do the conversion yourself.
* Text editors I use for record screening:

    * [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) with the [Markdown Preview Enhanced Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=shd101wyy.markdown-preview-enhanced) on macOS or Windows;
    * [Epsilon Notes](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ekartoyev.enotes) on Android.

* On [Zheln](https://zheln.com), records that **passed** the Step 2 of the appraisal process are automatically (since [_General Makeposti_ 2.2.1](https://github.com/p1m-ortho/qs-global-ortho-search-queries/commit/af6d75fa635c2d62169e9ec36505b9657a127ed9#diff-d556e85617be04293b0ad953ad7028b3)) assigned the `awaiting crowdfunding` status tag. That is because if I found the record appealing enough to autonomously embark on its full appraisal, I would have pushed it to the Step 3 of appraisal right away.
* From the other hand, records that **failed** the appraisal process at the Step 2 are reassigned the `awaiting appraisal` status tag. This is because I consider these a _ghost town_ analogy meaning that, theoretically, the appraisal could be continued, but for now, it wouldn‚Äôt.
* Also, a [corresponding footer](https://github.com/p1m-ortho/qs-global-ortho-search-queries/tree/global-sr-query/zheln) is attached to the record based on its Step status.

### Specialty-Tagging

(done at **Explanatory Steps 2 thru 10**)

* Specialty-tagging is done by the appraiser themselves based on whatever information they acquired during appraisal.
* The tags are chosen from [191 specialty tags](https://github.com/p1m-ortho/qs-global-ortho-search-queries/blob/global-sr-query/zheln/zheln_ama_specialty_tags.lst) made from a [list of 171 AMA Masterfile Physician Specialties](https://github.com/p1m-ortho/qs-global-ortho-search-queries/blob/global-sr-query/zheln/zheln_ama_specialty_tags_config.lst).
* See the methods used to compile the lists of specialties and specialty tags in the [commit history](https://github.com/p1m-ortho/qs-global-ortho-search-queries/commits/global-sr-query).
* While tagging, the tagger should consider if the record would be accessible from its most relevant [specialty page](https://github.com/p1m-ortho/qs-global-ortho-search-queries/blob/global-sr-query/zheln/zheln_ama_specialty_page_filenames.lst) and ensure it would.
* Namely, the tagger must check the record against **each** specialty on the list, assess if this record could be of interest to a typical physician working in this specialty, and choose one specialty that looks most relevant in this regard.
* If choosing one such specialty is hard enough, choosing more than one is acceptable. As such, adding more than one specialty tag is actively discouraged unless absolutely unavoidable, as it remarkably compromises appraisal speed. Therefore, multiple specialties are warranted if and only if it is perceived to be faster to multiselect than choose one among several.
* I do recognize the best approach to specialty-grouping would be an evidence-based approach involving feedback from the physicians themselves. However, this is unavailable at the moment, so specialty-grouping will be theory-based. In the future, introducing empirical testing will be of interest.
* If the tagger is uncertain either of the article subject or any specialty scope, they should consult Google or other information sources until both seem perfectly clear.
* There is no limit to the number of specialty tags attached, but at least one tag should be chosen for each record. Exceptions:

    * Those records that failed and were exlcuded at Step 2 do not require specialty-tagging.
    * It became evident during appraisals that some records on PubMed cover topics rather distant from health care, e.g. [PMID 33035990](https://pubmed.gov/33035990)‚Äîsee its [Zheln counterpart](https://zheln.com/record/2020/10/09/3/). For these records, there may be no specialty tags added when each and every specialty tag clearly does not apply.

* I do not plan to add any new specialty tags. However, if I hear about any changes to the AMA Masterfile Physician Specialties list, I will consider updating the Zheln specialty lists accordingly.
* Specialty tags may be assigned or removed throughout further full appraisal if this is deemed appropriate to better reflect the content of the record.

### Collection of Reports

(aka **Explanatory Step 3**)

* Will try to collect the original full text associated with the record under appraisal either using publicly available electronic resources or via private subscriptions or communication.
* For some records, collection of other reports (either written by the same authors or by different authors, like in case of important referenced research) will be required and will be done: `3. ‚úÖ Full Text & Other Reports Collected by Zheln`.
* In some, only _other reports_ but not the original record full text will be available: `3. ‚úÖ Other Reports Collected by Zheln`.
* If I have collected the original full-text report and this report only, will put the `3. ‚úÖ Full Text Collected by Zheln` label. If no full-text report is available for the record, I will put the `3. ‚ùå No Full Text Available to Zheln` label, place the record in the `awaiting crowdfunding` category, and reference it in the **Full Text Wanted** section of [twice-weekly summary posts](https://github.com/drzhelnov/zheln.github.io/issues?q=is%3Aissue+summary+in%3Atitle).
* I will not routinely contact the authors or search extensively for additional reports, but if the study is somehow specifically important or additional appraisal is crowdfunded, will do that.

### Data Extraction

(done at **Explanatory Step 4**)

* Involves extracting the pragmatic outcomes that I deemed relevant for evidence-based practice.
* This is done only if the Step 9 summary is conducted. If so, I will extract the data directly in the text of the appraisal.
* I will decide what outcomes to extract depending on the research question. As a rule, I will choose one among all outcomes mentioned in the study reports and will contrast it to the outcomes usually used in similar studies to decide if this is an acceptably practice-important and question-relevant outcome.
* To learn what outcomes are best suited for similar research questions, I‚Äôm planning to use informal electronic search (Google, PubMed, etc.), that I‚Äôm not planning to document, but I will summarize important information on this matter, including references, if applicable, in the text of the appraisal.
* If I did find such appropriate outcome in the study reports, I will use it as a _primary outcome_ to then assess effectiveness of the interventions. Also, I will tick this study as `4. ‚úÖ Generates Pragmatic Evidence Directly Relevant to Evidence-Based Practice`.
* Otherwise, if I did not find any appropriate outcomes reported, I will put the `4. ‚ùå Does Not Generate Pragmatic Evidence Directly Relevant to Evidence-Based Practice` label and abstain from further appraisal.

### Critical Appraisal

(done at **Explanatory Steps 4 thru 8**)

* The methods of critical appraisal may be described in one phrase:
  
  Informal study of the review documentation with replication of some of the elements of the review by a single appraiser to formulate their expert impression as to whether the review is reproducible and whether it is useful for evidence-based practice.

* Please find by-step description below.
* [Step 4](#data-extraction) has been described in detail previously.
* Step 5:

    * First of all, I will assess if the study under appraisal looks duplicate. To find out, I‚Äôm planning to use informal electronic search (Google, PubMed, etc.), that I‚Äôm not planning to document, but I will summarize important information on this matter, including references, if applicable, in the text of the appraisal.
    * If I find evidence the study is duplicate (same population, same context, same interventions, same outcomes, with no reasonable reference to previous research), I should naturally not start answering the research question at this study but use previous research first. Therefore, I will abstain from appraising duplicate studies and will mark them as `5. ‚ùå Is Duplicate`.
    * Otherwise, I will mark the study appropriately as `5. ‚úÖ Not Found Duplicate by Zheln` and go on with the appraisal.

* Step 6:

    * If a systematic review features practice-important outcomes _and_ does not look duplicate, it feels safe and appropriate to embark on its replication.
    * In the course of Zheln, I‚Äôm not planning to conduct exhaustive replications. In contrast, I‚Äôm going to try and replicate selectively those review steps that look both easiest and most natural to redo.
    * For example, rerunning PubMed/MEDLINE searches and replicating the review study set is usually simple enough and appealing, as is reproducing a random couple of data extraction forms. I will document these replication processes in the text of the appraisal.
    * If I deem the replication attempts more or less successful, I will label the study as `6. ‚úÖ Passed Replication`.
    * Otherwise, if the replication has largely failed, I will mark the study as `6. ‚ùå Failed Replication` and abstain from further appraisal because an irreproducible review is hardly systematic anymore.

* Step 7:

    * Replicability is a sign of sound conduct and good reporting but does not guarantee robustness of the review. Therefore, additional quality-of-conduct assessment is required.
    * Some tools have been developed to assess risk of bias in systematic reviews, such as¬†[ROBIS](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/population-health-sciences/projects/robis) or [CINeMA](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1003082). However, they are rather recent, and there is evidence agreement is low at least for some of them ([Gates 2020](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jclinepi.2020.04.026)).
    * In contrast, [MECIR](https://community.cochrane.org/mecir-manual) have been out there for quite some time now. Also, it has been neatly integrated into [Cochrane Handbook 6](https://training.cochrane.org/handbook/current) that provides further insight into these issues.
    * Thus, I elect to use the [MECIR conduct standards](https://community.cochrane.org/mecir-manual/standards-conduct-new-cochrane-intervention-reviews-c1-c75) to assess quality of conduct. I will go over all 75 MECIR conduct items at Step 7 to get an understanding and will document for each item if it was followed, in my view. I will also provide rationale where relevant. All the documentation will take place directly in the appraisal text.
    * In general, I expect _mandatory_ MECIR items to be followed, whereas _highly desirable_ items may be ignored. However, I acknowledge that MECIR standards (1) are not absolute and (2) were developed for intervention reviews only (whereas Zheln may feature other systematic reviews as well). Also, some of the items would look critical for one review and not critical for another.
    * Hence, the final decision about whether or not I have observed evidence of critical conduct flaws is always mine to make; at the same time, I will do my best to accurately substantiate my findings in the appraisal text. My decision may be `7. ‚ùå Has Critical Conduct Flaws`, `7. ‚úÖ No Critical Conduct Flaws Identified by Zheln`, or `7. ‚úÖ No Conduct Flaws Identified by Zheln`, depending on those findings.

* Step 8 was designed as solely subjective: `8. üëç Liked by Zheln` if I find the review useful overall and `8. üëé Disliked by Zheln` if I find otherwise. I will provide any personal comment if my decision did not seem obvious.

### Data Synthesis

(aka **Explanatory Step 9**)

* Only done if Steps 2 thru 7 checked green. Otherwise, I don‚Äôt find the review robust enough to look at or disseminate its findings.
* Involves formulating explicit practice-relevant statements based on the health outcomes extracted at Step 4 and quality-of-conduct assessment at Step 7.
* Will be done directly in the appraisal text, stressed, and placed at its top.

### Publication

(done at **Explanatory Step 10**)

* Involves creating a citation for each post on Zheln, see [this issue](https://github.com/drzhelnov/zheln.github.io/issues/4).
* In reality, the record is published as soon as it is first uploaded after Step 2 and is then updated in the course of its appraisal.
* When I feel I am ready to submit the record for final publication and no additional appraisal work on the record is pending, I will check it as `10. ‚úÖ Appraisal Published & Call for Crowdfunding`. Unless Step 10 is ticked, the record is not to be considered final.
* Any record updates after the Step 10 tick have been set and published will be reported in the appraisal text.
* Also, Zheln appraisals are disseminated on public video platforms, such as [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMNQzA3-71TyD-fVbXnxfKQ) and [TikTok](https://tiktok.com/@drzhelnov). One full appraisal recorded on video is uploaded [every working day](https://github.com/p1m-ortho/qs-global-ortho-search-queries/blob/global-sr-query/zheln/Work_Schedule.md).

### Crowdfunding

(done at **Explanatory Step 10** and throughout Zheln)

* I ended all my institutional affiliations except for being a member of the [Society of Specialists in Evidence-Based Medicine, Moscow, Russia](http://osdm.org/english/). See [my employment history on ORCID](http://orcid.org/0000-0003-2767-5123) for more detail.
* Currently, I have no other jobs except self-employed research assistance; see [my freelancer website](https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=ru&tl=en&u=https%3A%2F%2Fhire.p1m.org) for more info on that.
* Therefore, there is no other funding for Zheln besides my private devotion & crowdfunding.
* Crowdfunding details are available from the [Zheln](https://zheln.com) website.
* If Zheln videos get popular enough in the future, will also monetize these using the [YouTube Partner Program](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/72857).

### Project Management

(irrespective of **Steps**)

* Zheln uses public [GitHub kanban boards](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/about-project-boards) to manage its workflow.
* Namely, important tasks needed to accomplish the [Zheln‚Äôs mission](#zhelns-mission) are created as public Projects on the [Zheln GitHub page](https://github.com/drzhelnov/zheln.github.io/projects), e.g. [Streamline Zheln](https://github.com/drzhelnov/zheln.github.io/projects/1) or [Register with PROSPERO](https://github.com/drzhelnov/zheln.github.io/projects/2).
* Further, these tasks are broken down into smaller blocks ([GitHub Issues](https://github.com/drzhelnov/zheln.github.io/issues)) and are displayed on the projects‚Äô kanban boards.
* Finally, each week, short-term [GitHub Milestones](https://github.com/drzhelnov/zheln.github.io/milestones) are created and then assigned to the Issues to track weekly progress.
* All of these elements are public. Issues are open for public comment (GitHub registration needed).
* To maximize publicity, Zheln additionally endeavors to publish [summary posts](https://zheln.com) twice a week, where I overview the events that happened on Zheln since the last summary and that I consider important.

## Results

* The monitoring continued from September 1, 2020.
* Currently, I do not plan to go back to whatever material that I left unreviewed as I do not have capacity for such an undertaking.
* Please see all current information on the results in the [latest Zheln summary posts](https://zheln.com).
* The [appraisal log](https://github.com/p1m-ortho/qs-global-ortho-search-queries/blob/global-sr-query/zheln/Appraisal_Log.md) is available separately.

> **How to use?**
>
> * Replace all the upper limit dates with the date needed using any text editor.
> * If you need to filter just the records indexed _on_ that date (instead of all the records indexed _by_ that date), then add the following fragment to the query (either before the first or after the last parenthesis): `(2020/09/09:2020/09/09[crdt] OR 2020/09/09:2020/09/09[dcom] OR 2020/09/09:2020/09/09[mhda])`, where the date is your required date (should be the same as the upper limit date).
> * If everything done correctly & the query itself still works, you will get a consistent set of records each time on whatever date you run the query.

## Appendix: How to Compile Zheln Records?

### General Notes

* Below you will find guidance on how to compile both _editable_ and _published_ versions of Zheln records for any given date.
* You will need [bash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_(Unix_shell)) to run the record-maker script aka _[General Makeposti](https://github.com/p1m-ortho/qs-global-ortho-search-queries/blob/a9b341280d55a6da24df037694a98f7bd6e4bc13/zheln/general-makeposti.sh)_. Set up bash on your platform before you get down to compilation.
* I wrote this guidance for [General Makeposti 2.3.2](https://github.com/p1m-ortho/qs-global-ortho-search-queries/blob/a9b341280d55a6da24df037694a98f7bd6e4bc13/zheln/general-makeposti.sh) on Oct 7, 2020. It may not work with other versions of the script or if other important changes happen after that date.

### _Editable Version_

1. Go to [PubMed](https://pubmed.gov); copy, paste, and run the [replicated version](#replicated-version) of the Zheln search query.
2. Press `Display options` and ensure the following values are set:
    
    * Format `Summary`
    * Sort by `Most recent` (decreasing order)

3. Press `Save` and set the following values:
    
    * Selection: `All results`
    * Format: `Summary (text)`

4. Press `Create file`.
5. Wait until the file is generated and downloaded. Afterwards, a `summary-systematic-set.txt` file will appear on your device.
6. Create a `summary-systematic-set` directory on your device and put this file there. Then rename the file to follow the `summary-systematic-set_%Y-%m-%d_%count.txt` convention, where:

    * `%Y` is the year used in the replicated search
    * `%m` is the month used in the replicated search
    * `%d` is the day used in the replicated search
    * `%count` is the number of _results_ retrieved when running the replicated search

    See examples of how these look like in the [summary-systematic-set](https://github.com/p1m-ortho/qs-global-ortho-search-queries/tree/global-sr-query/zheln/summary-systematic-set) directory in this repository.

7. Download all accessory files needed to run the compilation from the [zheln](https://github.com/p1m-ortho/qs-global-ortho-search-queries/tree/global-sr-query/zheln) directory in this repository:

    * All `footer` files
    * All `header` files
    * `general-makeposti.sh`
    * `zheln_ama_specialty_tags.lst`

8. Open the `general-makeposti.sh` file with any plain-text editor. Then look at the first 10 lines and procure the following:

    * `edit=true`
    * Set `date` to the date you used in the replicated search in the `yyyy-mm-dd` format
    * Set `count` to the number of _results_ retrieved when running the replicated search
    * Set `coreutils` to `false` if you are using the native GNU Bash; otherwise, set it to `true` if you are using the [CoreUtils](https://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/) package
    * Other variables are irrelevant to successful compilation

9.  Run `general-makeposti.sh` with bash.
10. If everything went fine, the script would produce the following message when finished:

    `> Populate the random list first.`

    Also, a plain-text LST file would appear in the newly created `rnd` directory (see the [rnd](https://github.com/p1m-ortho/qs-global-ortho-search-queries/tree/a9b341280d55a6da24df037694a98f7bd6e4bc13/zheln/rnd) directory in this repository for comparison).

11. Go to the [RANDOM.ORG Random Sequence Generator (Advanced Mode)](https://www.random.org/sequences/?mode=advanced) and set the following parameters:

    * Leave `Smallest value` at `1`
    * Set `Largest value` to the value of your `count` variable you set up earlier
    * Leave `Format in ‚Ä¶ column(s)` at `1 `
    * Choose Output Format: `As a bare-bones text document (type text/plain)`
    * Choose Randomization: `Generate your own personal randomization right now`

12. Press `Get Sequence`; open your LST file in the `rnd` directory with any plain-text editor and copy & paste the generated list of random numbers into it.
13. Run `general-makeposti.sh` with bash again.
14. If everything went fine, the script would produce the following message when finished:

    `> So uncivilized.`

    In this case, you‚Äôd find your editable records in the `posts-edit` directory.

15. If unsuccessful, follow instructions by the script or feel free to contact me here on [GitHub](https://github.com/pussiatoday) or by [email](mailto:pavel@zheln.com).

### _Published Version_

1. Procure editable versions of the records you want first. You can either take precompiled records from the [posts-edit](https://github.com/p1m-ortho/qs-global-ortho-search-queries/tree/global-sr-query/zheln/posts-edit) directory in this repository or [compile them yourself](#editable-version).
2. Open the `general-makeposti.sh` file with any plain-text editor. Then look at the first 10 lines and procure the following:

    * `edit=false`
    * Set `date` to the date of your editable records in the `yyyy-mm-dd` format
    * Set `count` to the number of your editable records (should equal the number of records retrieved by the replicated search on the date of your editable records)
    * Set `coreutils` to `false` if you are using the native GNU Bash; otherwise, set it to `true` if you are using the [CoreUtils](https://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/) package
    * Other variables are irrelevant to successful compilation

3. Run `general-makeposti.sh` in bash.
4.  If everything went fine, the script would produce the following message when finished:

    `> So uncivilized.`

    In this case, you‚Äôd find your published records in the `posts` directory.

5.  If unsuccessful, follow instructions by the script or feel free to contact me here on [GitHub](https://github.com/pussiatoday) or by [email](mailto:pavel@zheln.com).
