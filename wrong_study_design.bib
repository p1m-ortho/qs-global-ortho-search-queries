  abstract={A prospective study of 33 patients with skeletal complications of brucellosis is reported. The diagnosis depends on the brucellar agglutination titre because the clinical, radiological and histological features are not specific, and blood culture and culture of synovial fluid are often negative. The commonest site is the sacroiliac joint, and brucellosis must be differentiated from tuberculosis as an important cause of backache. Treatment is with chemotherapy, the preferred combination being rifampicin and co-trimoxazole. Relapse can occur, but the chances can be reduced by careful clinical monitoring, and by repeated serological tests and gallium scanning; it is treated by further chemotherapy. Operation is indicated to relieve spinal cord compression or to drain a large paravertebral abscess.},

  abstract={The aim of this retrospective study was to investigate the effect of adjuvant hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) therapy on the duration of antibiotic treatment and rate of radiological improvement in the management of spinal tuberculosis. We reviewed a total of 51 patients with tuberculous spondylitis of the spine who were treated by percutaneous abscess drainage or radical surgical debridement with chemotherapy, and of whom 16 randomly selected patients also received adjuvant HBO therapy and 35 did not. Serological markers were monitored in the course of treatment. Percutaneous needle biopsy was performed on each patient before treatment. Spine and chest radiographs, CT scans and MRI were performed. Infection control was achieved in all patients and no recurrence occured. To our knowledge this is the first reported series of patients with spinal tuberculosis treated with HBO therapy as an adjunct to antituberculous chemotherapy. This combination provided earlier clinical and radiologic improvement than chemotherapy alone.},

  abstract={Objective: 
To study of clinical manifestations of osteoarticular tuberculosis.
Material and method: 
This study is an observational retrospective study design from the electronic medical record database of Siriraj Hospital in 2005-2006.
Results: 
Ninety- nine patients fit in to the inclusion criteria. All were non HIV-infected. There were 44 males (44.4%) and 55 females (55.6%) with a male/female ratio of 8:10. The mean and median age was 50.9 +/- 19.8 and 50 years, respectively, with a range from 1-85 years. The most frequent chief complaint was pain (84.8%), followed by functional disability/neurological deficit (47.5%), constitutional symptoms (38.4%), fever (24.2%), localized swelling (21.2%), fistulas and drainage (11.1%) and discovery as a co-morbid disease (1%). The most frequent clinical manifestation was tuberculous spondylodiscitis (66.7%) followed by tuberculous septic arthritis (28.3%), tuberculous osteomyelitis (10.1%), tuberculous tenosynovitis (4.0%), tuberculous bursitis (2.0%) and tuberculous pyomyositis (2.0%). Concurrent pulmonary TB was 30.3%. The mean and median time to diagnosis was 20.4 +/- 16.9 and 13 weeks, respectively, with a range from 4 days to 104 weeks. The shortest duration of time to diagnosis was 0-4 weeks (19.2%) followed by 12-16 weeks (14.1%) and 20-24 weeks (13.1%). The longest duration of time to diagnosis was 104 weeks (1%). The diagnosis from histopathology was 46.5%, positive AFB 40.4%, positive PCR 33.3% and positive culture 19.2%. The radiological abnormalities were osteolytic lesion (79.8%), narrowing intervertebral disc space/joint space (54.5%), cold abscess (49.5%) and vertebral collapse (43.4%). Surgery with medical treatment was performed on 72.7% while the percentage of those receiving medical treatment only was 27.3%. The results of treatment were improvement with residual deformities/dysfunction occurring in 97%. Death occurred in 3%.
Conclusion: 
Osteoarticular tuberculosis is common in all age groups. Tuberculous spondylodiscitis was the most frequent clinical manifestation in Siriraj Hospital, Thailand. Although the patients were provided with adequate medical and surgical therapy, osteoarticular tuberculosis was still associated with mortality and morbidity.},

  abstract={Objectives: 
To describe the clinical characteristics of patients with abscess on the psoas muscle (PA) and to identify the possible differences existing between pyogenic and tuberculous etiologies.
Patients and methods: 
A retrospective review of patients diagnosed of PA in one hospital was conducted (1983-2009). Two groups were established, that is pyogenic and tuberculous, and the clinical findings, analyses and evolution were compared.
Results: 
Thirty PA were included, 83% pyogenic and 17% tuberculous, average age 53 years. On 9 occasions, 30% were primary and on 21 occasions, 70% secondary (to skeletal pathology in 8, to urological in 8 and to gastrointestinal in 8). No clinical differences were observed between both groups. Pyogenic and tuberculous etiologies were differentiated analytically through leukocyte values (13,871 vs. 8,560/mm(3), p=0.018), hemoglobin (11 vs. 14 g/dL, p=0.008) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) (108 vs. 17 mm/h, p<0.0001). Abscesses were diagnosed by computed tomography (CT) in 29 patients (97%) and by magnetic resonance in 1 (3%), both with a diagnostic sensitivity of 100%, as opposed to 50% for ultrasound scanning. Left laterality was less frequent in pyogenic abscesses (44% vs. 100%, p=0.031). The blood cultures were positive in 22% and abscess pus culture in 82%. Gram negative bacilli, Streptococcus spp. and S. aureus were the most frequent isolations. A total of 67% were drained: transcutaneously 50%, surgically 13% and both techniques 3%. Two patients died (7%), both with pyogenic abscess.
Conclusions: 
Secondary pyogenic abscesses constitute the most frequent PA group. CT is the diagnostic procedure of choice. Leukocytosis, anemia, raised ESR and right laterality suggest pyogenic etiology. Transcutaneous drainage is substituting surgical drainage and also makes it possible to obtain diagnostic samples.},

  abstract={Background: 
The objective of this study was to compare the outcomes of one-stage posterior surgery involving debridement, bone grafting, and instrumentation with and without local continuous chemotherapy and postural drainage for the treatment of lumbar spinal tuberculosis.
Methods: 
From January 2009 to January 2013, 109 patients with lumbar spinal tuberculosis were treated in our center using a posterior surgical approach. Patients underwent one-stage posterior debridement, bone grafting, and instrumentation, without (group A) and with (group B) local continuous chemotherapy and postural drainage. Clinical and radiographic results for the two groups were analyzed and compared. Clinical efficacy was evaluated based on surgery duration and blood loss. The Frankel scale was used to evaluate neurological function. A visual analog scale was used to assess low back pain. Bone graft fusion and instrumentation failure were monitored by radiography, and tuberculosis activity was monitored by erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein testing.
Results: 
Groups A and B contained 52 and 57 patients, respectively. Patients were followed for 18-36 (mean, 26.64 ± 4.2) months. All bone grafts ultimately fused, but the fusion rate was significantly more rapid in group B [6.4 ± 0.5 (range, 5-10) months] than in group A [8.9 ± 0.6 (range, 6-12) months; P < 0.05]. At 6 weeks postoperatively, ESR levels differed significantly between groups A and B (24.6 ± 1.5 vs. 16.3 ± 1.1 mm/h; P < 0.05). ESR levels normalized in both groups at 16 weeks.
Conclusions: 
Local continuous chemotherapy and postural drainage effectively eliminated infection foci caused by abscess remnants and accelerated interbody bone fusion in patients with lumbar spinal tuberculosis undergoing one-stage posterior surgery involving debridement, bone grafting, and instrumentation.},

  abstract={Background: 
Psoas abscess complicating tuberculous spondylitis is a rare morbidity in extrapulmonary tuberculosis. There are no established guidelines for evaluating the clinical response of psoas abscess. Although several studies have shown that positron emission tomography-computed tomography with 18 F-fluorodeoxyglucose can play a potential role in diagnosing multifocal tuberculosis and monitoring the clinical response of pulmonary tuberculosis, to our knowledge, this is the first report demonstrating that positron emission tomography-computed tomography is useful for evaluating local inflammation and disease activity of a tuberculous psoas abscess.
Case presentation: 
We report a case of multifocal bone and lymph node tuberculosis with concomitant lumbar psoas abscess in a 77-year-old man, along with a literature review. An initial positron emission tomography-computed tomography scan showed intense 18 F-fluorodeoxyglucose accumulation in the sternum, ribs, vertebrae, and lymph nodes. The patient was successfully treated with antitubercular agents and computed tomography-guided drainage therapy. A follow-up positron emission tomography-computed tomography after abscess drainage and 9 months of antitubercular drug treatment revealed that the majority of lesions improved; however, protracted inflammation surrounding the psoas abscess was still observed. These results indicate that disease activity of psoas abscess can remain, even after successful drainage and antitubercular medication regime of appropriate duration.
Conclusion: 
We have successfully followed up the extent of skeletal tuberculosis complicated with psoas abscess by positron emission tomography-computed tomography. In this patient, positron emission tomography-computed tomography is useful for evaluating the disease activity of tuberculous psoas abscess and for assessing the appropriate duration of antitubercular drug therapy in psoas abscess.},

Spinal tuberculosis as all other osteoarticular tuberculosis occurs as a result of hematogenous dissemination of Mycobacterium tuberculosis from a primarily infected visceral focus mainly lungs, but Pott's paraplegia occurring secondarily to Scrofuloderma has not been reported till date.
Purpose: 
To document such an association of Pott's paraplegia and Scrofuloderma.
Methods: 
A 29-year-old female presented to us with low backache and paraplegia of 1 month duration. Clinical examination showed multiple healed Scrofuloderma lesions over sterum and neck (Figure 1). Magnetic resonance imaging (Figure 4), computed tomography (Figure 3) and X-ray (Figure 2) showed Pott's spine involving dorsal vertebrae (D8-10) with pre and paravetebral abscess with intraspinal extension. She was treated by minimally invasive surgery to drain pus and granulation tissue by resecting transverse process of D9 vertebra. Drained material was sent for histopathological examination, Zielh-neelsen (ZN) staining, culture and sensitivity for M. tuberculosis. Patient completely recovered neurologically after 1 month of surgery.
Results: 
Patient completely recovered neurologically after surgery and is presently on multidrug chemotherapy and spinal brace.
Conclusions: 
Pott's paraplegia can occur secondary to Scrofuloderma and it can be managed by multidrug antitubercular therapy and minimally invasive surgical procedure.},

Hematogenous vertebral osteomyelitis is caused predominantly by Staphylococcus aureus. The rise in incidence of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) has complicated the treatment of this infection. Our objective was to evaluate therapeutic outcomes for S. aureus vertebral osteomyelitis in a setting of high MRSA prevalence.
Methods: 
We conducted a retrospective chart review of all patients who presented with S. aureus vertebral osteomyelitis over a 7-year period at 2 tertiary care hospitals in Houston, TX, USA.
Results: 
Thirty-five patients were identified who received > or =2-week course of parenteral antibiotics and had a follow-up period of at least 12 months post-therapy. MRSA was responsible for 20 (57%) cases. Mean duration of total antibiotic therapy was 61.4 days. The overall relapse rate was 14%. At 12 months post-therapy, 86% patients were cured. The one factor significantly associated with relapse was presence of undrained abscesses (p=0.04).
Conclusions: 
When the mean duration of effective antibiotic therapy was 60 days, cure rates for S. aureus vertebral osteomyelitis exceeded 80%. Drainage of all associated abscesses correlated with a significantly higher rate of cure.},

  abstract={Objectives: 
Thai aims of this study were to provide an epidemiological and microbiological analysis of psoas abscess in the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected population, and to describe the optimal investigative and management approach of this condition.
Methods: 
A retrospective chart analysis of 20 patients with a diagnosis of psoas abscess admitted to a regional academic hospital from January 2012 to December 2014 was performed.
Results: 
Twenty patients with psoas abscess were identified, of which 14 were HIV positive (70%) and five HIV negative (25%). One patient remained untested (5%). The mean CD4 count was 402 cells/mL (range 150-796 cells/mL, median 367 cells/mL). Acid fast bacilli were positive in psoas abscess aspirates in 13 cases (65%). Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli were identified in 15% of cases. The radioisotope bone scan showed increased vertebral uptake in 10 patients (62.5%), with the lumbar spine (L1-L4) being most commonly involved (31%). There was a statistically significant increase in radioisotope uptake in the lumbar vertebrae in tuberculous psoas abscess than in pyogenic psoas abscess (p=0.003). Ultrasound-guided percutaneous drainage was used in 16 patients (80%) with a success rate of 87.5%; only two cases required repeat drainage (12.5%). Open drainage was used in four patients (30%) with a 100% success rate. There were no mortalities at 30-day follow-up.
Conclusion: 
Tuberculous psoas abscess from underlying vertebral osteomyelitis is more common than pyogenic psoas abscess. Ultrasound has high diagnostic accuracy and guides percutaneous drainage with excellent success rates. Ultrasound-guided percutaneous drainage should be regarded as the first-line therapeutic modality.},

A retrospective study was conducted on 33 patients with bone or joint TB concurrent with TB of other organs, especially the lung, who were admitted to our hospital between 1981 and 2005. The patients were divided into the following three groups according to the organ of concurrent TB : (1) miliary TB group (N = 10), (2) pulmonary TB group (N = 19), and (3) other TB site group (N = 4). The relationship between bone/joint TB and TB of other organs was studied by comparing the three groups with respect to the time of appearance of musculo-skeletal symptoms or signs such as swelling and pain and that of symptoms or signs originating from other organs, such as cough, sputum, miliary pattern on chest radiograph and superficial lymph node swelling.
Results: 
The mean age (SD) of patients was 50.5 (18.9) yr, and the male to female ratio was 23 : 10. Among 33 patients, bone TB (including 18 spinal TB) was detected in 24 patients, joint TB in 14, and abscess in 3 (concurrent lesions in some patients). The mean intervals from onset of symptoms to consultation (patients' delay), from consultation to diagnosis (doctors' delay) and from symptom onset to diagnosis (total delay) were 5.5 (13.9), 3.4 (5.2) and 8.9 (13.9) months, respectively. (1) Bone/joint TB concurrent with miliary TB (N = 10) In 8 patients with mean age of 61.0 (17.4) yr, musculo-skeletal symptoms/signs preceded respiratory symptoms or appearance of miliary pattern on chest radiograph by 7.8 (7.2) (range; 1-24) months. The patients', doctors' and total delays were 0.4 (0.5), 7.3 (7.8), and 7.7 (7.6) months, respectively. In most cases, bone/joint TB was diagnosed after the onset of miliary pattern on chest radiograph. In one patient with simultaneous onset of musculo-skeletal and respiratory symptoms/signs (age 21 yr), the interval of total delay was 1 month, and in one patient with musculoskeletal symptoms which appeared six months later than respiratory symptoms (age 28 yr), the interval of total delay was 2 months. (2) Bone/joint TB concurrent with active pulmonary TB (N = 19). In this group, the mean age was 52.2 (17.1) yr, and males were predominant (M/F = 15/4). Active pulmonary TB was diagnosed by positive sputum culture in 13 patients, by positive sputum smear or PCR results in 4 patients, and by the clinical course in 2 patients. Ten patients (53%) had a previous TB history. Cavitary lesion was observed in 15 patients, and the upper lobes were predominantly involved on chest radiograph in 19 patients, indicating that the pulmonary TB was probably post-primary (reactivation) in all patients. In 9 patients with mean age of 49.7 (15.7) yr, musculo-skeletal symptoms/signs preceded respiratory symptoms by 14.1 (14.0) (range; 4-48) months. The patients', doctors' and total delays were 13.3 (17.8), 3.8 (6.6), and 17.1 (16.1) months, respectively. On the other hand, in 10 patients with mean age of 54.5 (18.7) yr, musculo-skeletal symptoms/signs and respiratory symptoms/signs appeared simultaneously, and the total delay was 2.7 (1.9) months. Twelve of 19 patients (63%) had complications such as diabetes mellitus, steroid use, and liver diseases. In cases with miliary or pulmonary tuberculosis, the total delay in diagnosis (Y) correlates positively with the time lag from onset of musculo-skeletal symptoms to respiratory symptoms/signs (X), and the regression line (Y = 0.94X + 2.3, r = 0.98, p < 0.001) was almost linear (Y = X), indicating that the diagnosis of bone/joint TB was made just after the diagnosis of miliary or pulmonary TB. (3) Bone/joint TB concurrent with TB of other sites (N = 4) In 2 female cases (21 and 28 yrs) with cervical lymph node TB, musculo-skeletal symptoms/signs and cervical lymph node swelling appeared simultaneously. In a 54-yr male patient, musculo-skeletal symptoms/signs appeared 5 years after appearance of testicular enlargement, and testicular TB was diagnosed by biopsy simultaneously. In a 33 year-old male patient, musculo-skeletal symptoms/signs appeared 7 months after the drainage of pleural and pericardial effusions (TB was not diagnosed initially), and then the diagnosis of bone/joint, pleural, and pericardial tuberculosis was made for the first time.
Conclusions: 
In middle-aged or elderly patients with active bone/joint TB, miliary TB is sometimes caused by bacillemia originating from the infected bone/joint lesions. In cases with bone/joint TB and concurrent pulmonary TB, bone/joint TB and pulmonary TB are probably reactivated independently as a result of decreased systemic immunocompetence.},

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the outcomes of computed tomography (CT) guidance using percutaneous catheter with low-dose drainage local chemotherapy (modified PCD) and antituberculous therapy (ATT) for the treatment of spinal tuberculosis in children.
Methods: 
Twenty-seven children suffering from spinal tuberculosis were treated with modified PCD and ATT in our institute from 2002 to 2012. We describe our treatment, which involves CT-guided percutaneous puncture and local chemotherapy (continuous low-dose (20 mL) irrigation). The patients were evaluated based on the Frankel scoring system, the kyphotic Cobb angle, and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR).
Results: 
All patients were followed up for an average of 31.00 ± 13.94 months. No sinus formation was detected. All patients responded well to this treatment. The ESR values were decreased to normal at last follow-up. The neurological functions show significant improvement after operation. Preoperatively, the kyphotic angle was 22.89 ± 7.06°, and it was measured as 21.19 ± 8.73° at the last visit.
Conclusions: 
Our results showed that percutaneous intubation and low-dose irrigation under CT guidance (modified percutaneous catheter drainage (MPCD)) and ATT are easy, safe, efficient, and less invasive methods for the treatment of spinal tuberculosis in children.},

The authors report a case of Pott's disease in a child aged 3 years and 3 months who was referred to their attention due to the appearance of left inguinal swelling, fever and anemia. Diagnostic tests (ETG, CT, MR) showed an abscess involving the L5-S1 intersomatic space, the intervertebral disc and osteolytic lesions of S1, with impairment of the left psoas muscle and diffusion as far as the inguinal region. Chemotherapy was commenced using isoniazid, ethambutol, rifampicin, and streptomycin and lasted 24 months associated with drainage of the ileopsoas abscess. Conservative orthopedic treatment lasting for one year initially took the form of decubitus in bed with hyperdistension of the vertebral column, followed by the creation of a plaster-cast cot on the back and lastly a glass-reinforced resin orthopedic jacket. The follow-up of 2 years and 10 months showed recovery with reconstruction of the vertebral elements and the preservation of intervertebral space.},

  abstract={History and clinical findings: 
For about a year a 28-year-old Nigerian had been suffering from diffuse bone pain, intermittent fever, weight loss and weakness. Physical examination was unremarkable except for a swelling at the sternal angle.
Investigations: 
The tuberculin test was clearly positive and tests for inflammatory disease were elevated, but the chest radiograph was normal. Bone scintigraphy demonstrated multiple sites of increased storage in the ribs and vertebral column. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a large paravertebral abscess, which was needled under computed tomography monitoring. Polymerase chain reaction of the aspirate demonstrated Mycobacterium tuberculosis.
Treatment and course: 
While initial treatment with combined isoniazid, streptomycin, rifampicin and pyrazinamide, the first two drugs had to be discontinued, the microorganism not being sensitive to them, and were replaced by ethambutol and amikacin. The abscess was drained and the vertebral fracture surgically stabilised. There were no neurological abnormalities and the lesions largely healed.
Conclusion: 
Even without pulmonary involvement tuberculosis must be included in the differential diagnosis of rheumatic diseases with joint and vertebral column involvement, such as the SAPHO syndrome and other inflammatory bone diseases.},

  abstract={Pott's disease, or tuberculosis of the spine, is the most common osteoarticular tuberculosis. Among them, dorsolumbar impairment is predominant. The authors report the case of a patient with a huge cold lumbar abscess associated with Pott's disease. The patient is a 32-year-old man presenting dorsolumbar tumefaction associated with an alteration in his general condition and fever for three months. Treatment by "traditional healers" did not provide any improvement. He consulted for mild lumbar pain triggered by fatigue appearing one week before and after the failure of the traditional practitioner. The clinical examination found a temperature of 38.5°C, cachexia, mild lumber kyphosis and impressive, soft, painless and non inflammatory dorsolumbar bruised tumefaction, 40 cm high, 15 cm wide and 7 cm deep. He did not present any neurological signs. The dorsolumbar X-ray of the spine revealed a lesion associated with Pott's disease in the first and second lumbar vertebrae with pinching of the disc, punched-out lesions and osteocondensation. The ultrasound examination of the soft tissue revealed the presence of a laterovertebral collection of fluid diffusing in the subcutaneous region. The psoas major and the paravertebral muscles were not affected. A scan or MRI of the spine was not carried out. Examination of the tissue sample and drainage of the abscess confirmed the tubercular origin. Treatment with tuberculostatic drugs for 12 months associated with immobilisation resulted in a cure with sequelae of mild kyphoscoliosis vertebral statics.},

  abstract={Study design: 
Case report, literature review, discussion.
Objectives: 
To emphasize the role of the spine as primary source of infection for psoas abscess.
Summary of background data: 
Spine-associated psoas abscesses increase with more frequent invasive procedures of the spine and recurring tuberculosis in industrialized countries. Diagnosis is often delayed by misinterpretation as arthritis, joint infection, or urologic or abdominal disorders.
Methods: 
We present six cases of psoas abscesses associated with spinal infections that were treated in our hospital from January to December 2001. Diagnostic and treatment concepts are discussed.
Results: 
Our data emphasize the importance of the spine as primary source of infection and suggest an increase in the incidence of secondary psoas abscess. Treatment includes open surgical drainage and antibiotic therapy. In patients with high operative risk and uniloculated abscess, a CT-guided percutaneous abscess drainage can be sufficient. It is essential to combine abscess drainage with causative treatment of the primary infectious focus. Related to the spine, this includes treatment of spondylodiscitis or implant infection after spinal surgery. Usually, several operations are necessary to eradicate bone and soft-tissue infection and restore spinal stability. Continuous antibiotic therapy over a period of 2-3 weeks after normalization of infectious parameters is recommended.
Conclusion: 
The spine as primary source of infection for secondary psoas abscess should always be included in differential diagnosis. Because the prognosis of psoas abscess can be improved by early diagnosis and prompt onset of therapy, it needs to be considered in patients with infection and back or hip pain or history of spinal surgery.},

CT scan, the most useful diagnostic test, showed abnormal results in 11 of 11 patients. MRI, a newer modality, may provide even more information. Eight patients required operation in addition to antimicrobial therapy. Four had lesions between T3 and T10, where the spinal canal is narrow, of whom three (75 percent had neurologic involvement. All four underwent anterior approach (thoracotomy) for decompression, debridement, and spinal fusion. Fifteen had lesions between T11 and S2. Three (20 percent) had neurologic involvement but responded to medical treatment alone. Four underwent drainage of abscess or spinal fusion for deformity. Combined surgical and medical treatment gave excellent results in this series.},

Mortality was high (28%), even with early diagnosis and treatment; diabetes mellitus, alcohol abuse, and chronic renal failure were unfavorable prognostic factors. In patients with abscess formation early surgical drainage improved the outcome. However, often treatment was complicated by sequestration at inaccessible foci and secondary dissemination. Combined antibiotic therapy with flucloxacillin and chloramphenicol may be the most successful antibiotic regimen.},

  abstract={A case of tuberculous psoas abscess complicated during antituberculosis therapy for miliary tuberculosis and successfully treated with surgery was reported. A 20-year-old man visited our hospital because of fever lasting for 3 months. Chest radiography showed miliary nodules in both lungs and transbronchial lung biopsy revealed granuloma. Magnetic resonance imaging of the head showed small lesions in the brain. Computed tomography of the abdomen showed an enlarged paraaortic lymph node and a nodule in the spleen. Needle biopsy of the lymph node revealed necrotic tissue. Mycobacterium tuberculosis was not isolated; however, miliary tuberculosis was highly suspected based on clinical and radiographic findings. Once antituberculosis therapy was initiated with isoniazid, rifampicin, streptomycin, and pyrazinamide, the fever subsided. In spite of improvement of general radiographic findings, a new abscess was found in the right psoas major muscle after 8 months of therapy by computed tomography. A sample of the abscess showed a positive smear, negative culture, and positive PCR test for M. tuberculosis. Although antituberculosis therapy continued for another 6 months, the abscess enlarged to 7 cm and new retroperitoneal lymph nodes also appeared. Surgical drainage and curettage of the abscess was performed. Intra- and post-operative specimens were negative for bacteria, fungi, and M. tuberculosis. The patient was treated with isoniazid, rifampicin, and ethambutol for one year postoperatively. The disease disappeared without any evidence of relapse for 2.5 years after surgery.},

  abstract={Background context: 
Postoperative spondylodiscitis (PSD) is a known complication of lumbar disc surgery. The etiology of the disease is usually bacterial, but several uncommon infectious agents have also been described; however, there are no reports about postoperative colonization with Mycobacterium bovis bacille Calmette-Guérin after lumbar discectomy.
Purpose: 
To describe the case of PSD caused by M. bovis BCG, and to discuss diagnostic and therapeutic interventions as well as possible pathogenic mechanisms of the disease.
Study design: 
Case report and review of the literature.
Methods: 
A 31-year-old man was operated on because of L4-L5 lumbar disc herniation. Two months later, the patient presented with gradual increase of back pain, and magnetic resonance imaging confirmed PSD. He started to receive antibacterial treatment and was reoperated on because of progressive neurological deficits due to epidural abscess. Neurological status improved, but a fistula developed with intermittent pus drainage from the operative scar.
Results: 
Microbiological cultures were repeatedly obtained from the pus, but all the initial stains and cultures were negative. Four months after the reoperation, the culture for M. bovis BCG from the pus appeared to be positive. The patient received antituberculosis regimen, including isoniazid, rifampin, ethambutol, and ofloxacin. The clinical symptoms resolved, and antituberculosis treatment was discontinued after 14 months.
Conclusions: 
Mycobacterium bovis BCG must be considered in the differential diagnosis of PSD. Microbiological analysis and radiological studies are vital components in diagnosis; if there is any suspicion of BCG osteomyelitis, proper diagnostic and therapeutic management must be instituted without delay to avoid an unfavorable outcome.},

  abstract={Background: 
Vertebral osteomyelitis (VO) may lead to disabling neurologic complications. Little evidence exists on optimal antibiotic management.
Methods: 
All patients with primary, non-implant VO, admitted from 2000-2010 were retrospectively analyzed. Patients with endocarditis, immunodeficiency, vertebral implants and surgical site infection following spine surgery were excluded. Persistence of clinical or laboratory signs of inflammation at 1 year were defined as treatment failure. Logistic regression was used to estimate the odds ratios (OR) of switch to an oral regimen after 2 weeks.
Results: 
Median antibiotic treatment was 8.1 weeks in 61 identified patients. Switch to oral antibiotics was performed in 72% of patients after a median intravenous therapy of 2.7 weeks. Switch to oral therapy was already performed after two weeks in 34% of the patients. A lower CRP at 2 weeks was the only independent predictor for switch to oral therapy (OR 0.7, 95% confidence interval 0.5-0.9, p = 0.041, per 10 mg/l increase). Staphylococcus aureus was the most frequently isolated microorganism (21%). Indications for surgery, other than biopsy, included debridement with drainage of epidural or paravertebral abscess (26 patients; 42%), and CT-guided drainage (3 patients).During the follow-up, no recurrences were observed but 2 patients died of other reasons than VO, i.e. the 1 year intention to treat success rate was 97%.
Conclusions: 
Cure rates for non-implant VO were very high with partly short intravenous and overall antibiotic therapy. Switching to an oral antibiotic regimen after two weeks intravenous treatment may be safe, provided that CRP has decreased and epidural or paravertebral abscesses of significant size have been drained.},

  abstract={A 69-year-old man underwent a radical cystectomy and cutaneous ureterostomy for carcinoma in situ of the urinary bladder. The ureteral stents were exchanged for cutaneous ureterostomy 35 days after the operation. The patient suffered from high fever with chills a few hours after the stent exchange, and was readmitted to our hospital. High fever was not improved by treatment with Ceftriaxone for 5 days. Five days after the stent exchange, computed tomography (CT) revealed a right psoas abscess. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was detected in the blood culture. Urine culture showed MRSA, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterococcus faecium. Computed tomography-guided percutaneous catheter drainage and treatment consisting of vancomycin, minocycline and ciprofloxacin were performed for the psoas abscess. This treatment significantly reduced the size of the abscess and high fever was improved. The catheter was removed 22 days after the drainage. However, magnetic resonance imaging revealed a spondylitis at L4 and L5. Therefore, antibiotics treatment was continued for about 3 months. There has been no sign of recurrence of bladder cancer and psoas abscess at 23 months after the operation.},

  abstract={Objective: 
Iliopsoas abscess (IPA) is a rare condition with a reported worldwide incidence of 12 new cases per year with primary abscesses now predominating. The presentation is often vague and the diagnosis not considered.
Method: 
The medical records of 15 consecutive patients presenting to our hospital in a 3-year period with IPA were reviewed. Demographic data, presenting features, predisposing factors and the investigations performed were recorded. Abscesses were classified as primary or secondary and the treatment provided and eventual outcomes were analysed.
Results: 
Fifteen patients (eight males) were included. Nine patients were pyrexial on admission, 14 were anaemic and all had raised inflammatory markers. Only five patients presented with the classical triad of pain, fever and limp. The median time to diagnosis was 3 days with a median hospital stay of 27 days (range 7-243 days). Fourteen patients were diagnosed by computed tomographic scan. Three patients were treated with antibiotics alone whilst 11 received percutaneous drainage (PCD) as well. Of these, five had recurrence following initial drainage, needing further PCD procedures but none needed open drainage. Only one patient underwent open drainage initially. The mortality rate was 20%.
Conclusion: 
The incidence of IPA is probably under-reported. The vague presentation leads to delays in diagnosis and increases morbidity and a high index of suspicion is the key to early diagnosis. Percutaneous drainage with antibiotics is the first line of treatment although recurrence rate is high. Open drainage allows simultaneous treatment of underlying pathology in secondary abscesses.},

  abstract={Objective: 
To analyze the characteristics of abscesses of the psoas muscle and assess the differences between pyogenic and tuberculous abscesses.
Methods: 
Retrospective descriptive study of all patients with psoas abscess in our hospital over the period 1994 to 2004.
Results: 
Fourteen patients were studied (10 males), with a mean age of 42 years. Half of them had had an underlying disease. The most frequent clinical manifestations were abdominal pain (64%), fever (57%), and back pain (43%). All the abscesses were secondary. In 7 patients the origin was gastrointestinal, in 6 osteoarticular, and 1 was related with infection of an aortobifemoral bypass. Computed tomography was the diagnostic imaging method in all patients. Culture of drainage specimens was positive in 92% of patients undergoing this procedure. Causal microorganisms included Mycobacterium tuberculosis (5), Streptococcus intermedius (4), Staphylococcus aureus (3), Escherichia coli (3) and Bacteroides fragilis (2). Tuberculous abscesses originated in spondylitis and the clinical presentation was longer prior to diagnosis. Drainage was performed in 12 patients (8 percutaneous and 4 surgical). Mean duration of antimicrobial therapy was 4 weeks. The infection resolved in all patients.
Conclusions: 
Psoas abscess commonly had a gastrointestinal and osteoarticular origin. We underscore the high percentage of tuberculous etiology, which had a more insidious clinical and analytical presentation and was usually secondary to spondylitis. Prolonged antimicrobial treatment associated with drainage was effective therapy.},

A single center pilot study, open labeled, prospective randomized clinical trial.
Objective: 
To compare six versus 12 months of anti TB therapy in patients with biopsy proven spinal TB.
Summary of background data: 
There is no clear consensus or evidence based guidelines for the duration of treatment of spinal tuberculosis. We studied if 6 and 12 months of anti tubercular therapy (ATT) had equivalent outcomes at 24 months from completion of therapy.
Methods: 
A prospective randomized open labeled clinical trial of 6 versus 12 months ATT in patients with biopsy proven spinal-vertebral tuberculosis. The primary end point was absence of recurrence 24 months after completing therapy. Secondary end points were clinical cure at the end of therapy, significant adverse effect of ATT, need for delayed surgery, and residual neurological dysfunction.
Results: 
Hundred patients, randomized to 6 or 12 months ATT, were followed up for a minimum of 24 months from completion of therapy. All patients completed scheduled duration of ATT, with one crossover from 6 months ATT group to 12 months. There were no recurrences of disease on the 24 months follow up following completion of ATT. All 100 patients met criteria for cure at time of stopping medicines. One patient (12 months group) had residual neurological dysfunction at the time of stopping treatment, which completely resolved over the next 12 months.There were no patients with major drug induced hepatitis. One patient (12 months group) needed percutaneous drainage of an abscess. None needed surgical re-exploration for persistent infection of implant removal.
Conclusion: 
This pilot study concludes that, in patients with biopsy proven spinal-vertebral, TB, 6 and 12 months of ATT give similar clinical outcomes at 24 months of completion of therapy.

  abstract={Objective: 
To investigate the clinical efficacy of cortical bone trajectory (CBT) screws in the treatment of elderly patients with lumbar spinal tuberculosis.
Methods: 
A total of 45 elderly patients with lumbar spinal tuberculosis were allocated to 1 groups based on different surgical methods: 22 patients in group A received posterior CBT screw fixation combined with anterior debridement with a small incision and bone grafting, and 23 patients in group B underwent posterior pedicle screw fixation combined with anterior debridement with a small incision and bone grafting. The intraoperative blood loss, postoperative drainage volumes, Cobb angles, visual analogue scale scores, erythrocyte sedimentation rates (ESRs), and Frankel grades before and after surgery were analyzed. The surgical complications and spinal fusion were also assessed.
Results: 
After a 3-month follow-up, 2 patients in group A and 3 patients in group B experienced anterior psoas muscle abscesses, which were cured by a second surgery. The remaining patients were healed by the first surgery. Spinal fusion after bone graft required 3 to 8 months (average, 4.9 months). There were no significant differences in surgery time, blood loss, drainage volume, and hospital stay between the 2 groups. The visual analogue scale scores, Cobb angles, ESRs, and Frankel grades were significantly improved after surgery in both groups.
Conclusion: 
The CBT screws were not inferior to traditional pedicle screws. The application of CBT- screws fixation combined with anterior debridement with a small incision and bone grafting was an effective and safe method to treat elderly patients with lumbar spinal tuberculosis.},

Surgical drainage is indicated in patients with septic arthritis and in those with periosteal abscess. Staphylococcus aureus is involved in BJIs in children at all ages; Kingella kingae is a very common causative pathogen in children under 4 years of age. The French Pediatric Infectious Disease Group recommends in children > 3 months of age empirical antibiotic therapy with appropriate coverage against methicillin-sensitive S. aureus with high doses (150mg/kg/day) of intravenous amoxicillin-clavulanate, cefuroxime or cefazoline. In most children with uncomplicated BJI, short intravenous antibiotic therapy for 3 days can be followed by oral therapy. The minimum total duration of antibiotic therapy should be 10 days for septic arthritis and 3 weeks for osteomyelitis.},

  abstract={BACKGROUND Tuberculous infection of the lumbar spine may be associated with psoas abscess. The aim of this clinical study was to compare the outcome of posterior lumbar debridement and spinal fusion, combined with either a one-stage anteroposterior (AP) or posterior (P) approach to percutaneous catheter drainage (PCD) for the treatment of lumbar tuberculosis with psoas abscess. MATERIAL AND METHODS From January 2008 to June 2012, 74 patients were diagnosed at our hospital with lumbar tuberculosis with unilateral or bilateral psoas abscess. Forty-three patients underwent P-PCD (group A), and 31 patients underwent AP-PCD (group B). Operative duration, blood loss, the length of hospital stay, spinal correction, clinical cure rate, and other clinical outcomes in the two groups were compared. RESULTS Comparison of the outcome for the P-PCD and AP-PCD patients showed that there was no significant difference in outcome for spinal bone fusion, correction of spinal deformity, or cure rate from tuberculosis infection (P>0.05). Blood loss, operative time, and the length of hospital stay for patients in group A, the P-PCD group, were significantly less than for group B, the AP-PCD group (P<0.05). Also, group B, the AP-PCD group, had an increased incidence of complications than group A, the P-PCD group, leading to increased hospital stay (OR 3.04, CI 0.52-17.75). CONCLUSIONS For the treatment of tuberculous psoas abscess using PCD, the posterior approach may achieve the same clinical efficacy as the anteroposterior approach, but is associated with reduced length of hospital stay, and lower risk of complications.},

Data from 48 patients with spinal TB with paravertebral abscesses who received individualized chemotherapy via computed tomography-guided catheterization between 2009 and 2012 were retrospectively analyzed. The paravertebral abscesses affected the thoracic vertebra (n=12), the lumbar spine (n=20), the thoracolumbar vertebra (n=10), and the lumbosacral (n=6). All patients achieved clinical healing with no recurrence. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate and visual analog scale scores decreased significantly by the endpoint of follow-up. Although C-reactive protein values increased slightly right after treatment, they were also significantly lower at last follow-up. The kyphotic angle and Oswestry Disability Index values also exhibited significant decreases. No neurologic function impairment was reported.

All patients received initial conservative treatment but achieved unsatisfactory results and then underwent minimally invasive spinal canal decompression, focus debridement and catheter drainage through a posterior interlaminar approach. Postoperatively, a short-course (1-2months) of local chemotherapy was given. The patients were followed up on a regular basis. The neurologic status was graded according to the American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) score system. Kyphotic deformity was evaluated using Cobb angle measurement. Patients were followed up for an average of 37months (range: 12-96months). At the last follow-up, ASIA scores were improved in all patients, and there was a mild increase in the Cobb angle, but satisfactory spinal stabilization was achieved. Hepatorenal function, erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein levels all returned to normal. One complication was observed, where the patient had worsened deficit postoperatively but achieved a satisfactory recovery (from Grade C to Grade E) one year after a second surgery.

  abstract={Objective: 
To compare two kinds of method for treating lumbar tuberculosis with psoas abscess, to provide reference for clinical reasonable select of therapy treatment.
Methods: 
From January 2010 to January 2013,42 patients with lumbar tuberculosis combined with psoas abscess with obvious surgical indications were enrolled, including 24 males and 18 females with an average age of (38.5 ± 10.2) years old ranging from 21 to 63 years old. All patients were followed up for 18 to 24 months with an average of 20.9 months. Twenty-two patients underwent posterior vertebral body lesions cleared, bone graft fusion and internal fixation and percutaneous puncture catheter drainage for treatment of psoas major abscess as group A, and twenty patients underwent one-stage extraperitoneal approach to remove abscess, posterior vertebral body lesions cleared, bone graft fusion and internal fixation as group B. The operative time, loss of blood, length of hospital stay, clinical cure rate and other clinical results for the two groups were analyzed and compared.
Results: 
The loss of blood was (452.3 ± 137.6) ml in group A and (603.5 ± 99.6) ml in group B, there was significant statistical difference (P < 0.05). The time of operation was (193.6 ± 91.2) min in group A and (230.5 ± 56.6) min in group B, there was significant statistical difference (P < 0.05). The time of operation and the loss of blood in group A were obviously less than which in group B. In group A 20 cases were cured and 2 cases relapsed, 19 cases were cured and 1 case relapsed in group B, there was no significant statistical differences between two groups regarding cure rate with chi-square test (χ² = 0.000, P = 1.000). All patients in two groups obtained good clinical curative effect. There were no significant statistical difference between two groups regarding for length of hospital stay with t-test (P > 0.05).
Conclusion: 
Lumbar spinal tuberculosis with psoas abscess is not absolute indications for anterior open operation. Compared with the combined anterior and posterior surgical procedure, the percutaneous puncture catheter drainage combined with posterior debridement, interbody fusion and internal fixation can achieve the same clinical effect but less trauma for the patients.},

A total of 641 (TSD, 314 and BSD, 327) spondylodiscitis patients from 35 different centers in four countries (Turkey, Egypt, Albania, and Greece) were included.
Outcome measures: 
The pre- and peri- or post-treatment spinal deformity and neurologic deficit parameters, and mortality were carried out.
Methods: 
Brucellar spondylodiscitis and TSD groups were compared for demographics, clinical, laboratory, radiological, surgical interventions, treatment, and outcome data. The Student t test and Mann-Whitney U test were used for group comparisons. Significance was analyzed as two sided and inferred at 0.05 levels.
Results: 
The median baseline laboratory parameters including white blood cell count, C-reactive protein, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate were higher in TSD than BSD (p<.0001). Prevertebral, paravertebral, epidural, and psoas abscess formations along with loss of vertebral corpus height and calcification were significantly more frequent in TSD compared with BSD (p<.01). Surgical interventions and percutaneous sampling or abscess drainage were applied more frequently in TSD (p<.0001). Spinal complications including gibbus deformity, kyphosis, and scoliosis, and the number of spinal neurologic deficits, including loss of sensation, motor weakness, and paralysis were significantly higher in the TSD group (p<.05). Mortality rate was 2.22% (7 patients) in TSD, and it was 0.61% (2 patients) in the BSD group (p=.1).
Conclusions: 
The results of this study show that TSD is a more suppurative disease with abscess formation requiring surgical intervention and characterized with spinal complications. We propose that using a constellation of constitutional symptoms (fever, back pain, and weight loss), pulmonary involvement, high inflammatory markers, and radiological findings will help to differentiate between TSD and BSD at an early stage before microbiological results are available.},

  abstract={Blastomycosis is a rare fungal infection that primarily produces acute lung infections but may disseminate to multiple sites, including the spine. Once vertebral involvement occurs, an untreated infection may result in vertebral body destruction and paraspinal and epidural abscess formation followed by neurologic injury and loss of structural integrity of the spine. We report the case of a 30-year-old man who had pulmonary blastomycosis (treated with oral itraconazole for 6 months) and presented with a 2-month history of mild thoracolumbar back pain and numbness and tingling in the lower extremities, but no neurologic deficits. Imaging revealed a destructive lesion of T11 with an extensive paravertebral and retropleural abscess tracking a spinal level above and below with extension into the spinal canal. The patient underwent incision and drainage, culture procurement and corpectomy of T11 with autogenous rib graft in a titanium cage, and, 1 week later, posterior fusion and instrumentation. Cultures were positive for Blastomycosis dermatitidis. Oral itraconazole was continued. Blastomycosis that disseminates to the spine may cause serious neurologic and structural complications. In most cases, long-term use of antifungal medication eradicates the infection. Should medical treatment fail, however, surgery is a useful option.},

To compare single-stage posterior transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion, debridement, posterior instrumentation, and postural drainage (posterior-only surgery) with a combined posterior-anterior surgical approach for treatment of adults with lumbosacral spinal tuberculosis (STB) with paraspinal abscess and to determine the clinical feasibility and effectiveness of posterior-only surgical treatment.
Methods: 
Thirty-nine patients with lumbosacral STB and paraspinal abscess were treated with one of two surgical procedures in our center from September 2003 to December 2012. Nineteen patients were treated with posterior-only surgery (Group A) and 20 were treated with combined posterior-anterior surgery (Group B). Surgery duration, intraoperative blood loss, length of hospitalization, bony fusion rates, complication rates, neurological status, lumbosacral angle correction, and Kirkaldy-Willis functional outcomes of the two groups were compared.
Results: 
The average follow-up period was 39.1 ± 12.0 months for Group A and 40.7 ± 12.4 months for Group B. Under the Frankel classification, all patients improved with treatment. STB was completely cured and grafted bones were fused within 5-11 months in all patients. There were no persistent or recurrent infections or obvious differences in radiological results between the groups. The lumbosacral angle was significantly corrected after surgical management, but loss of correction was seen in both groups. The average operative duration, blood loss, length of hospital stay, and postoperative complication rate of Group A were lower than those of Group B.
Conclusions: 
Posterior-only surgery is feasible and effective, resulting in better clinical outcomes than combined posterior-anterior surgeries, especially in surgical time, blood loss, hospital stay, and complications.},

  abstract={Introduction: 
Brucellosis is an endemic zoonosis in Portugal. Brucellar spondylodiscitis is one of the most frequent focal manifestations which may cause severe sequelae despite appropriate therapy.
Material and methods: 
Retrospective study of patients with diagnosis of brucellar spondylodiscitis admitted to the Infectious Diseases Department of Centro Hospitalar e Universitário de Coimbra, over a 25-year period (1988-2012).
Results: 
We identified 54 patients, 55.6% male, mean age of 54.8 years. In 81.5% an epidemiological context was identified, mostly contact with sheep and goats. The duration of symptoms prior to diagnosis was 5.5 months. The most common signs and symptoms were pain (98.1%), fever (46.3%) and neurological deficits (25.9%). Spinal magnetic resonance imaging was the most used imaging method (77.8%) showing abscesses in 29.6% of patients. Lumbar location predominated (77.7%). Diagnosis was attained in 47 patients (87.0%): positive blood cultures (3 patients), positive serology (32 patients) or by both methods (12 patients). Combined regimens of doxycycline and rifampicin (64.8%), or streptomycin (24.1%) were most used, for an average duration of 4.4 months. A patient was referred for surgery for abscess drainage. Evolution was mostly favorable (92.6%), no deaths occurring.
Discussion: 
Research of the epidemiologic context turned out to be a major key leading to the diagnosis. Treatment of osteoarticular brucellosis is still controversial.
Conclusions: 
Brucellar spondylodiscitis should be considered in the differential diagnosis of patients with low back pain, even in the absence of fever, particularly in regions where the disease is endemic. Antibiotic regimen, its' duration and the need for surgery should be individualized to achieve a better prognosis. Cases have declined over the years, a fact related to better control of animal endemic.},

  abstract={Introduction: 
Rhodococcus (R) equi is an opportunistic, uncommon human pathogen that causes mainly infection in immunocompromised hosts. The disease is usually presented as subacute pneumonia that is mostly cavitary and sometimes bacteremic.
Case report: 
We reported the extremly rare case of a 43-year-old woman with Hodgkin lymphoma, who developed R equi pulmonary infection after recieving multiple courses of chemotherapy. Secondary, the patient developed bacteremia, leading to sepsis and dissemination of R equi infection in many extrapulmonary sites. At addmission the patient was febrile, tachypnoic, tachycardic, hypotensive, with fa cial edema, splenomegaly, positive meningeal signs, left hemiparesis and paraparesis. Laboratory data included erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) > 140 mm/h, C-reactive protein (CRP) 143.0 mg/L, red blood cells (RBC) 2.14 x 10(12)/L, whyite blood cells (WBC) 2.8 x 10(9)/L, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) 706 U/L, serum albumin 26 g/L, sodium 127 mmol/L and potassium 2.7 mmol/L. Blood culture and culture of sputum and empyema were positive for R equi. Imaging studies demonstrated a large right cavitary pneumonia and abscess, empyema, pericarditis, mediastinal and intra-abdominal lymphadenopathy, brain and psoas abscesses, osteomyelitis and spondylodiscitis. The patient recovered completely after a 12-month treatment with combinations of parenteral and oral antibiotics (meropenem, vancomycin, teicoplanin, ciprofloxacin, rifampicin, macrolides etc), including drainage of abscesses and empyema. Eight years after completition of the treatment the patient was without recurrence of R equi infection and lymphoma.
Conclusion: 
Since the eradication od R equi is very difficult, it is very important to make the diagnosis and initiate appropriate antibiotic therapy as soon as possible.},

Pharmacotherapy must be combined with surgery in patients with spinal cord or nerve root compression, large abscesses, or marked anterior column osteolysis with kyphosis and instability. The quality of debridement and bony fusion is optimal when the anterior approach is used. Posterior fixation is the best means of achieving reduction followed by stable sagittal alignment over time.

  abstract={Purpose: 
The treatment of spinal infection remains a challenge for spinal surgeons because of the variable presentations and complicated course. The diagnostic and therapeutic value of percutaneous endoscopic lavage and drainage (PELD) has been proved in some recent studies. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of PELD in patients with advanced infectious spondylitis which may traditionally require open surgery.
Methods: 
We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 21 patients who underwent PELD to treat their advanced lumbar infectious spondylitis. Patients with severe infection resulting in significant neurological deficit and mechanical instability were excluded from the PELD procedure, which was only used on selected patients with less severe disease. The 21 patients were categorized into three groups based on their past history, clinical presentation, and imaging studies: those with paraspinal abscesses, postoperative recurrent infection, and multilevel infection. Clinical outcomes were assessed by careful physical examination, Odom's criteria, regular serologic testing, and imaging studies to determine whether continued conservative treatment or surgical intervention was necessary.
Results: 
Causative bacteria were identified in 19 (90.5%) of 21 biopsy specimens. Appropriate parenteral antibiotics for the predominant pathogen isolated from the infected tissue biopsy cultures were prescribed for the patients. All patients reported satisfactory recovery and relief of back pain, except three with multilevel infections who underwent anterior debridement and fusion within 2 weeks after treatment with PELD. The overall infection control rate was 86%. One patient with epidural abscess and spondylolytic spondylolisthesis of the L5-S1 received instrumented fusion surgery due to mechanical instability 5 months later. No surgery-related major complications were found, except 2 patients who had transient paraesthesia in the affected lumbar segment.
Conclusions: 
PELD was successful in obtaining a bacteriologic diagnosis, relieving the patient's symptoms, and assisting in eradication of lumbar infectious spondylitis. The indications of this minimally invasive procedure could be extended to treat patients suffering from spinal infections with paraspinal abscesses and postoperative recurrent infection. Patients with multilevel infection may have trivial benefits from PELD due to poor infection control and mechanical instability of the affected segments.},

Iliopsoas abscess (IPA) is a collection of pus in the iliopsoas compartment, which is considered rare in Japan. However, the number of patients with IPA has recently increased among the elderly or compromised hosts.
Subjects and methods: 
This retrospective study aims to examine the clinical pictures, pathological findings, and the prognostic factor of IPA. We analyzed all patients with IPA who were admitted to our hospital from April 2006 to July 2011. Patients' characteristics, treatment, clinical outcome, radiological findings, bacteria isolated, and comorbidities were evaluated. The comorbidities were evaluated by the Charlson comorbidity index (CCI). We compared the survival and non-survival groups to assess the prognostic factors of IPA.
Results: 
A total of 33 patients were enrolled in this study, which included 14 males and 19 females. The mean age of the patients was 71.5 years (range 32-92 years). The most common underlying disease was spinal disease (16 of 33, 48.5%). Twenty-nine patients (87.9%) were cured and four patients (12.1%) died. While 12 patients (36.4%) were initially treated conservatively with antibiotics alone, percutaneous drainage was performed initially in 19 patients (57.6%). Two patients (6%) directly underwent exploratory surgery and open drainage. In terms of patients' characteristics, there were no significant differences in either group. The score of CCI in non-survivors was higher than that in survivors (1.38 vs. 5.5, P < 0.001).
Conclusions: 
The epidemiology of IPA is quite different from what it used to be. CCI appears to be useful in evaluating the patients' prognosis with IPA.},

To evaluate the best treatment of Pott's disease.
Materials and methods: 
7 cases of Pott's disease were treated in the department of Neurosurgery of Sapienza University of Rome (Italy) between 2004 to 2011.
Results: 
All patients underwent surgical drainage of abscess and vertebral stabilization. In all cases culture exam showed positivity after 40 days of incubation. After surgery for a period of one year chemotherapy was administered. In all cases MRI scan with gd of the spinal column were performed 12 months after surgery and no recurrence of disease has been shown.
Discussion: 
Pott's disease is defined as vertebral involvement of extrapulmonary Tubercolosis (TB), involving mainly toraco-lumbar tract of the spine. MRI with gd represents the gold standard for the diagnosis. Treatment can be medical, surgical or usually both. The slippery course of the disease often causes a delay in getting to a diagnosis that is not made prior to rising signs, such as large abscess, neurological impairment or vertebral fractures. In these cases medical treatment alone did not show effective results, because no specific antibiotic drug can permeate the abscess's capsule, and an effective concentration is not achieved in the infection's site. Therefore, surgical treatment is necessary to abscess draining and setting the correct medical treatment to mycobacterial eradication.},

  abstract={Objectives: 
Erysipelas is an animal disease caused by Gram-positive bacteria Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae. Among the domestic animals, domestic pig (Sus scrofa f. domestica) suffers most frequently from the disease in human environment. This is a typical animal-borne disease observed mainly in occupational groups employed in agriculture, farming (of animals and birds), fishing and manufacturing industry.
Methods: 
We are presenting the clinical course of infection (E. rhusiopathiae) and discuss clinical forms. E. rhusiopathiae in humans may have the following clinical course: mild form of skin infection diagnosed as local erythema (erysipeloid), disseminated form of skin infection and the most serious form of infection of systemic course (endocarditis and sepsis). Mild skin infection and local erythema are the most common forms. Very rare case of animal-borne infection course has been presented in which after initial phase the disease was generalised to the abscesses formation in paravertebral space, spondylitis and empyema formation in spinal canal. In the presented clinical case, the patient was suffering from diabetes. It was probably an additional risk factor of the disease generalisation. Patient underwent drainage of empyema in spinal canal, after which his neurological status gradually improved. Antibiotic therapy was implemented and continued for 8 weeks. Such course of erysipelas was not previously described in the literature.
Results: 
After  therapy neurological status was improved. In follow MRI control exam empyema and spondylitis was successfully eliminated.
Conclusions: 
Various complications of the disease, such as endocarditis and heart valves disturbances, are well known and are the most severe complications of the generalised infection. Proper targeted and long-term antibiotic therapy is crucial.},

  abstract={Introduction: 
The present study was aimed at reviewing the iliopsoas abscess (IPA) from a contemporary perspective, on the basis of experience from two tertiary referral centres.
Material and methods: 
We performed a retrospective analysis of 35 cases of IPA diagnosed between 1998 and 2009. Their clinical and microbiological features were recorded, as well as their long-term outcome according to the type of treatment: antibiotics alone (10 patients), or antibiotics plus percutaneous drainage or surgery (25 patients).
Results: 
Primary abscess occurred in 8 patients. The most frequent source of secondary abscesses was spondylodiscitis. The classic clinical triad (fever, pain and functional impairment) was present in 10 patients, with a median duration of symptoms before diagnosis of 12 days. Staphylococcus aureus was the most frequently isolated microorganism. At the end of a median follow-up of 454 days, the risk of poor outcome (related death and/or relapse) was higher among patients with diabetes mellitus (44.4% vs. 7.7%; P=.027), with no significant differences according to the therapeutic approach (20.0% in the group of antibiotics alone vs. 28.0% in the group with drainage or surgery).
Conclusions: 
In our series, most cases of IPA were due to S. aureus and secondary to a skeletal source. Antibiotic therapy seems effective in the long-term, although diabetic patients had a higher risk of relapse.},

  abstract={Objectives: 
Iliopsoas abscesses (IPAs) are rare infections involving purulence within the muscles of the iliopsoas compartment, seldom due to Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) historically. This study was designed to evaluate the clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients with IPAs.
Methods: 
A retrospective analysis of the demographics, clinical presentation, microbiologic data and treatment modalities among patients with IPAs from 1993 to 2007 at The Johns Hopkins Hospital was performed.
Results: 
Among 61 patients with IPAs, infection rates increased from 0.5 cases/10,000 admissions (1993-2004) to 6.5 cases/10,000 admissions (2005-2007) (P < 0.001). An adjacent infectious focus was identified in 80% of patients, from skeletal (48%), intra-abdominal (23%), vascular (5%), genitourinary (3%), and cutaneous sources (2%). During 2005-2007, MRSA became a predominant pathogen, accounting for 25% of all cases and 37% of cases with a definitive microbiologic diagnosis (P = 0.006). Patients with IPAs >2 cm were more likely to undergo drainage, with trends toward longer hospitalizations, longer antibiotic courses, and increased odds of securing a definitive microbiologic diagnosis.
Conclusions: 
Since 2005, rates of IPA have dramatically increased, with MRSA now the leading cause of infection. Knowledge of common pathogens should guide antimicrobial therapy including empiric coverage for MRSA in institutions with similar populations, especially if culture data are not available.},

Review of historical archival records.
Objective: 
Describe Harvey Cushing's patients with spinal pathology.
Summary of background data: 
Harvey Cushing was a pioneer of modern surgery but his work on spine remains largely unknown.
Methods: 
Review of the Chesney Medical Archives of the Johns Hopkins Hospital from 1896 to 1912.
Results: 
This is the first time that Cushing's spinal cases while he was at the Johns Hopkins Hospital, including those with Pott disease, have been described.Cushing treated three young men with psoas abscesses secondary to Pott disease during his residency: he drained the abscesses, debrided any accompanying necrotic vertebral bodies, irrigated the cavity with salt, and left the incision open to close by secondary intention. Although Cushing used Koch's "tuberculin therapy" (of intravenous administration of isolated tubercular bacilli) in one patient, he did not do so in the other two, likely because of the poor response of this first patient. Later in his tenure, Cushing performed a laminectomy on a patient with kyphosis and paraplegia secondary to Pott disease.
Conclusion: 
These cases provide a view of Cushing early in his career, pointing to the extraordinary degree of independence that he had during his residency under William Steward Halsted; these cases may have been important in the surgical upbringing both of Cushing and his coresident, William Stevenson Baer, who became the first professor of Orthopedics at Johns Hopkins Hospital. At the turn of the last century, Pott disease was primarily treated by immobilization with bed rest, braces, and plaster-of-paris jackets; some surgeons also employed gradual correction of the deformity by hyperextension. Patients who failed a trial of conservative therapy (of months to years) were treated with a laminectomy. However, the limitations of these strategies led to the development of techniques that form the basis of contemporary spine surgery-instrumentation and fusion.},

  abstract={Purpose of the study: 
The present study reviews our experience of acute hematogenous osteomyelitis in 450 children over a period of 20 years from 1985 to 2004 at the Nouméa Territorial Hospital in New Caledonia. The objective was to formulate a new theory of the pathogenesis of this affection and to report our research on the disparity in the pathology between temperate countries and our own tropical Pacific area.
Patient and methods: 
Only children with an initially normal X-ray and showing symptoms for less than one week were included in the study. Subacute osteomyelitis, infant osteoarthritis and spinal and sacroiliac joint infections were all excluded. All children were treated according to a preestablished protocol including: clinical examination; blood tests; ultrasound, to determine the presence and size of the periosteal elevation and to exclude soft tissue abscess and frequent pyomyositis. Ultrasound was used in the decision to treat with antibiotics alone or with surgery. Computed Tomography was used for deep structures assessment and medical therapy guidance Surgery was limited to open drainage of the subperiosteal abscess only. Regular follow-up of outpatients was continued until normal blood test and X-ray results were achieved.
Results and discussion: 
Four hundred and fifty children with a diagnosis of acute hematogenous osteomyelitis were identified, giving an average incidence of 22 new cases per year (range, 12-35). This incidence was two to five times as high as found in Europe. Fifty-three percent of our cases required surgical drainage (vs. 20 % in Europe). Ethnically, 60 % of the children were Melanesian and 20 % Polynesian (both represented less than 50 % of the local population). A similar incidence, about four times as high as in the population of European descent, was reported in Polynesians by our neighbors in New Zealand. The limbs were affected in 90 % of cases, and specifically lower limbs in 70 %. Multiple osseous lesions and systemic infection were recorded in 43 children (9.5 %). Blood cultures and surgical samples were positive in 80 % of cases, and otherwise negative. All the children were successfully treated, without chronic evolution or sequelae needing secondary surgery. The predominant microorganisms isolated were Staphylococcus aureus, in 81 % of cases, none of which were methicillin-resistant, and group A Streptococcus in 7.5 % of cases. A previous study of soft-tissue S. aureus infection showed the presence of Panton-Valentine Leukocidin (PVL) genes in 89 % of cases. These very infrequent genes are responsible for leukotoxic apoptosis, producing leukocidin, causing local acute aggressiveness. A parallel study, in progress for more than a year, is focusing on detecting PVL genes in S. aureus isolated from acute osteomyelitis: in the first nine children analyzed, PVL genes were likewise detected in 89 % of the S. aureus isolated, with no methicillin resistance. Ultrasonography allowed positive diagnosis in 64 % of cases on the day of admission and 84 % by the second day. Because of this very early presence of subperiosteal abscess at the beginning of the disease, and several other issues raised in the present study, we believe that Trueta's theory of acute osteomyelitis pathogenesis does not provide any logical explanation for our anatomoclinical observations. We believe that the primary focus of infection is in the osteoperiosteal area rather than under the growth plate in the metaphyseal bone. The term of Acute Osteo-Periostitis would therefore be much more suitable. A history of blunt trauma was found in 63 % of cases in the present series, and often reported in the literature. We speculate that two forms of infection fixation may develop: a local form, where bacteria carried by the blood stream reach a subperiosteal edema or hematoma secondary to blunt trauma, which is in our opinion the most frequent cause; and a general form, where fixation occurs as single or multifocal osteoperiostitis, and multivisceral locations in severe forms of septicemia. The disparity in this pathology between temperate countries and our own tropical Pacific area is certainly due to PVL-positive S. aureus and ethnic factors. The high prevalence of Melanesian and Polynesian patients confirms that they are at high risk of musculoskeletal infection in New Caledonia as in other Pacific countries, and it is possible that these ethnic groups are genetically susceptible to PVL-positive strains.
Level of evidence: 
Level IV. Retrospective case series.},

  abstract={Background context: 
Salmonella vertebral osteomyelitis is a well-known complication of sickle cell disease. However, it has been infrequently reported in immunologically normal people or diabetic patients.
Purpose: 
To report a case of Salmonella vertebral osteomyelitis in a diabetic patient with multiple rib infections, large bilateral psoas muscle abscesses, and pleural effusion.
Study design::Setting: 
Case report.
Methods: 
A case of Salmonella vertebral osteomyelitis is reported in a 42-year-old man with diabetes. The patient had multiple rib and T12 vertebral infections with pleural effusion and large bilateral psoas muscle abscesses. The adjacent discs were intact.
Results: 
Diagnosis was made by computed tomography-guided psoas muscle abscess drainage and aspirate culture. Appropriate antibiotic treatment resulted in a favorable outcome. The patient had mild back pain with a 38 degrees residual kyphosis at his thoracolumbar junction after treatment.
Conclusions: 
Vertebral osteomyelitis caused by Salmonella is uncommon in diabetic patients. Salmonella can cause multiple bone infections and large abscesses of psoas muscles in patients without sickle cell disease. Correct diagnosis can be confirmed by blood, biopsy, or abscess culture. Appropriate antibiotic treatment was effective.},

Surgeons are increasingly encountering psoas abscesses.
Methods: 
We performed a review of 41 adults diagnosed and treated for psoas abscess at a county hospital. Treatment modalities and outcomes were evaluated to develop a contemporary algorithm.
Results: 
Eighteen patients had a primary psoas abscess, and 23 had a secondary psoas abscess. Patient characteristics were similar in both groups. Intravenous drug abuse was the leading cause of primary abscesses. Secondary abscesses developed most commonly after abdominal surgery. Treatment was via open drainage (3%), computed tomography-guided percutaneous drainage (63%), or antibiotics alone (34%). Four recurrences occurred in the percutaneous group. Statistical analysis showed that the median size of psoas abscesses in the percutaneous group was significantly larger than in the antibiotics group (6 vs 2 cm; P < .001). The mortality rate was 3%.
Conclusions: 
Initial management of psoas abscesses should be nonsurgical (90% success). Small abscesses may be treated with antibiotics alone, and surgery can be reserved for occasional complicated recurrences.},

Psoas abscess is a rarely encountered entity with a non specific clinical presentation resulting in delayed diagnosis and treatment. No published data exist on this disease in our country.
Objective: 
To describe the diagnostic and therapeutic features of psoas abscesses in Côte d'Ivoire. Methodes: A retrospective study of 18 psoas abscesses seen over seven years in two teaching hospitals.
Results: 
There were 10 women and eight men with a mean age of 35.7 years (range:16-62 years). The abscess was primary in 15 cases, secondary in three, right sided in 15 and left sided in three cases. Fever, abdominal pain, difficulties in walk, abdominal mass and psoitis were the main clinical signs. Ultrasonography allowed the diagnosis of psoas abscess in 14 cases and in the remaining 4 cases the diagnosis was done peroperatively. The germs were identified in 12 patients and were: Escherichia coli in 3 cases, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Klebsiella pneumoniae in two cases each and Mycobacterium tuberculosis in one case. Patients were given antibiotics together with surgical drainage of the abscess (n=16) or percutaneous needle aspiration (n=2). Postoperative complications included parietal suppurations (n=5) and intraperitoneal abscesses (n=2). No death occurred.
Conclusion: 
For psoas abscess in our practice, ultrasonography is a useful diagnostic tool and surgical drainage remains an effective therapeutic method.},

Paradoxical reactions during adapted antituberculous treatment are defined as a transient, clinical and/or radiological enlargement of pre-existent lesions or appearance of new ones.
Observation: 
We report herein the case of a 62-year-old woman who suffered under treatment of Pott's disease from an enlargement of her para-vertebral abscess and disco-vertebral lesions, and a tuberculous paradoxical reaction characterized by the development of uni- then bilateral cervical lymph nodes. Outcome was favourable after drainage by percutaneous punction of the adenopathies and oral short course of corticosteroids, and the continuation of combined antituberculous therapy.
Conclusion: 
Paradoxical reactions under adapted antituberculous treatment must be considered only after excluding an inadequate or irregular intake, or absorption of antituberculous drugs. This phenomenon is not rare, and has been reported even in ten to 15% of the patients not infected with the human immunodeficiency virus. The adjunction of a short course of corticosteroids may be necessary and rapidly efficient to control these reactions, in combination with surgical or percutaneous drainage of the enlarged lymph nodes, to avoid unfavourable and/or unaesthetic fistulisations.},

  abstract={Classic procedure in the treatment of vertebral tuberculosis is drainage of the abscess, curettage of the devitalized vertebra and application of antituberculous chemotherapy regimen. Posterior instrumentation results are encouraging in the prevention or treatment of late kyphosis; however, a second stage operation is needed. Recently, posterolateral or transpedicular drainage without anterior drainage or posterior instrumentation following anterior drainage in the same session is preferred to avoid kyphotic deformity. Seventy-six patients with spinal tuberculosis were operated in the 1st Department of Orthopaedics and Traumatology, Ankara Social Security Hospital, between January 1987 and January 1997. There were four children in our series. Average follow-up period was 36.1 +/- 14.5 months and the average age at the time of operation was 40.8 +/- 15.2 years. This study reports the surgical results of 45 patients with Pott's disease who had anterior radical debridement with anterior fusion and anterior instrumentation [14 patients with Z-plate and 31 patients with Cotrel-Dubousset-Hopf (CDH system)]. The results are compared with those of 8 patients who had posterolateral drainage and posterior fusion, 12 patients who had only anterior drainage and anterior strut grafting and, 11 patients who had posterior instrumentation following anterior radical debridement in the same session in terms of fusion rates, correction of kyphotic deformity, recurrence rate and clinical results. All patients had one year consecutive triple drug therapy. Preoperative 23.2 degrees +/- 12.5 degrees local kyphosis angle was lowered to 6.1 degrees +/- 6.9 degrees with a correction rate of 77.4 +/- 22.3%. When the other three groups which had been instrumented were compared, the correction rates in the local kyphosis angle values were not statistically different and the variation in loss of correction at the last follow-up was also statistically insignificant. The sagittal contour of the involved vertebra's region did not change in the uninstrumented group, while it did so in instrumented groups which had normal range values postoperatively. Overall, 27 patients had neurologic deficits preoperatively. Twenty of these (74.1%) had complete, and 5 (18.5%) had partial recovery with a combined 92.6% neurologic improvement. All the patients had a solid fusion mass at the last controls. Reactivation was not seen. Additionally, contrary to the common belief, anterior instrumentation which anterior autologous strut grafting following anterior radical debridement can be a good treatment option with low complication rate, high correction rate in acute local kyphosis, and high fusion rate.},

Granulomatous infection was the principal offender in the past, but nowadays, with an increased number of patients at 'risk', the proportion of pyogenic infections has risen. Awareness of this is the essence of early diagnosis. The advent of magnetic resonance imaging has proved a major milestone; with its high sensitivity and specificity, it is an essential part of the diagnostic work-up. The treatment of spinal osteomyelitis follows the same basic principles as for any infection. Once the diagnosis has been established, early conservative treatment is commenced. Debridement, drainage of any abscesses, spinal decompression and stabilization are options in surgical treatment. The successful use of metallic implants to achieve correction and stabilization is probably helped by good perfusion of the vertebral body and accompanying good soft tissue coverage. The eradication of infection is therefore still possible.},

  abstract={Study design: 
Report of a successfully diagnosed and treated case of spinal cord compression due to epidural actinomycosis.
Objective: 
To illustrate that proper use of imaging strategy can greatly facilitate diagnosis and management of this rare condition.
Summary of background data: 
Spinal actinomycosis causing epidural abscess and significant spinal cord compression is an uncommon condition. Although diagnosis is difficult, favorable results are widely reported when specific therapy is instituted.
Methods: 
A 32-year-old Chinese man had extensive dorsal thoracic soft tissue swelling and lower limb weakness. Collapse of the T5 vertebral body was found on plain radiographs with mediastinal infiltrates on chest radiograph. It took magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to fully delineate the epidural abscess and dorsal muscular abscesses, which were not depicted by computed tomographic (CT) scan. Diagnosis was made by examination of CT-guided aspirate and tissue recovered during surgery by a microbiologist. The patient received high-dose intravenous penicillin and prompt spinal decompression once diagnosis of actinomycosis was confirmed.
Results: 
The dorsal muscular abscesses and upper thoracic epidural abscess resolved rapidly after intravenous antibiotics and surgical drainage. This was well documented by follow-up MRI and the full recovery of motor power and lower limb sensation in the patient.
Conclusions: 
High clinical suspicion and proper use of imaging data led to timely diagnosis of this rare case of mediastinal, epidural, and intramuscular thoracic actinomycosis. Specific antibiotic therapy and timely, well-targeted surgical intervention greatly improve the outcome of this condition.},

The PA diagnosed in the authors' center over a period of 91 months are presented, analyzing the main clinical features, microbiologic causal agents, risk factors, treatment and the differences between primary and secondary PA. A total of 19 cases of which 14 were secondary PA (73.7%) and 5 primary PA (26.3%) were diagnosed. The main foci of infection of the former were the bone and the genitourinary tract, with intestinal infection being rare. The most frequent clinical data were lumbar pain with possible irradiation to the lower limb, fever, and leucocytosis with neutrophilia. Gram negative and enteric anaerobes were the bacteria most often identified, followed by Staphylococcus aureus and Mycobacterium tuberculosis. In a high percentage of patients (57.8%) a history of immunodeficiency was reported. In regard to treatment, surgical drainage was performed in 5 cases (26.3%), while ten cases (52.6%) were treated by DPCT. Four patients (21%) were exclusively treated with antibiotics. Recurrence was observed in three cases (15.3%) of the DPCT group requiring new drainage. Of all the cases, 18 were cured while one death occurred, being attributed to the underlying tumoral disease of advanced stage. The authors believe DPCT to be a good therapeutic option in both primary and secondary PA, thereby avoiding the risks of major surgery. In the cases with no underlying immunodeficiency the existence of secondary PA should be discarded as occurred in 7 out of 8 cases with no history of immunodeficiency in this series of patients.},

Two patients required surgical drainage of paraspinal abscesses (one cervical and one lumbar).

  abstract={A 5-year-old male patient presented with flank pain, limping, weight loss, and cachexia. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed destructive vertebral changes, an epidural mass, psoas abscesses, and lack of involvement of the disc spaces. Blastomyces dermatitidis was isolated from a needle aspiration specimen. Sparing of the disc spaces, an unusual finding, suggested that the spread of infection was by way of paravertebral structures and surrounding potential spaces. Management was simplified by using gadolinium contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging, which indicated that the epidural mass was mainly solid, thereby obviating abscess drainage.},

  abstract={Background: 
An evaluation of the clinical characteristics and profitability of the diagnostic methods of myositis by Staphylococcus aureus was undertaken in favor of earlier diagnosis and treatment.
Methods: 
Twenty-eight cases of pyomyositis by S. aureus attended over the last nine years were studied. Inclusion criteria were: 1) compatible clinical manifestations, 2) demonstration of an abscess in CT and/or surgery, 3) isolation of S. aureus in abscess, hemoculture and/or neighboring tissue.
Results: 
Age: 36 +/- 18 years (limits 9-70). Sex: 23 males (82%). Neighboring pathology existed in 11 cases (39%). 5 sacroiliitis (18%), 4 spondyliodiscitis, 2 osteomyelitis. Favoring/predisposing factors: intravenous drug addiction in 11, staphylococcal sepsis in 6, diabetes mellitus in 4, previous surgery in 3, penetrating muscle injury in 3, and parametritis in 1. Fourteen cases (50%) corresponded to primary pyomyositis. The muscle most frequently involved was the psoas/iliacpsoas, followed by near the forearm muscle, spinal, gluteal, and upper pectoral muscles. In 16 cases (57%), only one muscle was involved, in 10 two muscles, and in 2 three groups. The time of clinical manifestation prior to consultation oscillated between 1.5-30 days, being less in cases of primary pyomyositis (p less than 0.0005). All the patients referred fever and local pain, with functional impotence in 26 (93%), general involvement, shivering and perspiration in 24 (86%). All the patients presented pain upon palpation. In 19 (68%) there was an increase in local temperature and in 18 a palpable mass. S. aureus was isolated in 16 hemocultures (sensitivity 57%), in 12 of 13 cultures of neighboring tissue (92%) and in all those aspirated from abscesses (100%). CT demonstrated muscular (thickening and/or destructuration or abscess) and neighboring pathology (if existent) in all cases. All the patients received medical treatment. Evacuating puncture was carried out in 7 cases, and surgical drainage in 23 (82%). Two cases were cured exclusively with medical treatment. Complications were seen in 8 cases (29%) and two patients died of staphylococcal sepsis.
Conclusions: 
1) In myositis by Staphylococcus aureus the percentage of primary pyomyositis is considerable. 2) In secondary pyomyositis the most frequent neighboring processes were sacroiliitis and spondylitis. 3) intravenous drug addiction was the most frequent predisposing factor. 4) The time of clinical evolution is variable although less in case of primary pyomyositis. 5) The performance of hemocultures was found to be greater than described and even greater in primary pyomyositis. 6) Abscess cultures and CT are the most efficient microbiological and imaging techniques in the early diagnosis of myositis by S. aureus.},

In general, such management is restricted to neurologically intact patients who are unable to undergo the needed surgical procedure and in whom the organism can be identified presumptively from other cultures. In such circumstances, brain abscesses less than 1.5 cm in diameter, small subdural empyemas, some spinal epidural abscesses, and many cases of spinal osteomyelitis can be successfully treated with prolonged intravenous antibiotic therapy. In patients who are unable to tolerate a neurosurgical procedure, the presence of an infectious CNS mass lesion is not hopeless and vigorous medical therapy offers the possibility of cure.},

  abstract={The presentation and management of eight patients with pyogenic psoas abscesses treated at the National Naval Medical Center, Bethesda, Maryland, between January 1986 and July 1989 are presented. The psoas abscesses were secondary to underlying gastrointestinal disease in six patients and sacral osteomyelitis in one patient. In one patient, the etiology of the abscess could not be determined. The average duration of symptoms in these patients was 16 days. Computed tomography was useful in identifying the abscess, defining its complexity, and planning therapy in all eight patients. Seven patients had complex, multiloculated abscesses, and one patient had a simple abscess. Extraperitoneal drainage was used in all patients. The patients with multiloculated abscesses had open surgical drainage, while the patient with the simple abscess had percutaneous catheter drainage. Most patients with a gastrointestinal etiology for their abscess underwent staged resection 3 to 6 weeks after the drainage procedure. There were no deaths, recurrent abscesses, or fistulae in these patients. Two patients developed thromboembolic complications postoperatively. Extraperitoneal drainage with staged resection of underlying gastrointestinal pathology is a safe and effective way of treating patients with psoas abscesses.},

The decline has been greatest in the 5-14 year age group and least in the over 65 group. Individual surgeons can now expect to see few cases in a practising lifetime. Effective chemotherapy is the key to successful treatment. Adequate biopsy is essential, but apart from the drainage of large abscesses the place of surgery in the early management of osteoarticular tuberculosis is discretionary. Early activity can usually be encouraged once chemotherapy is instituted, late reconstruction by joint arthroplasty being available if adequate function is not achieved.},

Of 20 patients (17 male and three female; mean age, 54 years), spondylitis was diagnosed soon after onset of the brucellosis in 15, there were significant systemic symptoms in 17, and blood cultures were positive for Brucella melitensis in 14. The main symptom was vertebral pain. The commonest radiographic changes were narrowing of the disk and epiphysitis. The discrete character of radiographic alterations and negative uptake on bone scanning caused diagnostic delays in three patients. 99mTc bone scans finally became abnormal in all patients, but were not useful for follow-up because low uptake persisted after the clinical status stabilized. Three patients had paravertebral abscesses; in two of them fever and pain persisted despite antibiotic therapy until diagnosis and surgical drainage. Finally, all patients were cured, ten with sequelae. Brucellar spondylitis often had an acute clinical course with bacteremia. Because neither clinical nor radiographic changes one year after onset were significant, long-term follow-up is not considered necessary except when paravertebral abscess is suspected.},
