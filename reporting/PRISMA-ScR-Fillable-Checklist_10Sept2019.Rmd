# TITLE

## 1 Title: Identify the report as a scoping review

A rapid electronic scoping updatable extensible review (RESCUER).

# ABSTRACT

## 2 Structured summary: Provide a structured summary that includes (as applicable): background, objectives, eligibility criteria, sources of evidence, charting methods, results, and conclusions that relate to the review questions and objectives

Background.

Objectives.

Eligibility criteria.

Sources of evidence.

Charting methods.

Results.

Conclusions.

# INTRODUCTION

## 3 Rationale: Describe the rationale for the review in the context of what is already known. Explain why the review questions/objectives lend themselves to a scoping review approach

See the `Backround of the review` section of the README.md.

## 4 Objectives: Provide an explicit statement of the questions and objectives being addressed with reference to their key elements (e.g., population or participants, concepts, and context) or other relevant key elements used to conceptualize the review questions and/or objectives

See the `Clinical question` section of the README.md.

# METHODS

## 5 Protocol and registration: Indicate whether a review protocol exists; state if and where it can be accessed (e.g., a Web address); and if available, provide registration information, including the registration number

Available at https://github.com/p1m-ortho/qs-global-ortho-search-queries/tree (select the corresponding branch and see the commit history).

## 6 Eligibility criteria: Specify characteristics of the sources of evidence used as eligibility criteria (e.g., years considered, language, and publication status), and provide a rationale

Usually not applied, apart from the clinical question requirements. If applied, would be indicated either directly as part of the search query strings or elsewhere throughout the README.md.

## 7 Information sources*: Describe all information sources in the search (e.g., databases with dates of coverage and contact with authors to identify additional sources), as well as the date the most recent search was executed

See the PRISMA-S attached (`Checklist Table Format 2.4.Rmd`), which in turn would redirect you to the README.md.

## 8 Search: Present the full electronic search strategy for at least 1 database, including any limits used, such that it could be repeated

See the PRISMA-S attached (`Checklist Table Format 2.4.Rmd`), which in turn would redirect you to the README.md.

## 9 Selection of sources of evidence‚Ä†: State the process for selecting sources of evidence (i.e., screening and eligibility) included in the scoping review

The screening process entails filling standardized CSV tables, one for each search query, pre-populated with the search results, using either special software (e.g. [PortoDB](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.portofarina.portodb)), or a general-purpose spreadsheet editor such as [Calc](https://www.openoffice.org/product/calc.html) or [Excel](https://products.office.com/en-us/excel), or a plain text editor.

See the screening table format in the `screening` directory. For each record, the screener is to tick either one of the fields below, or to tick none if none applies, and for each ticked, the bib must be placed within the corresponding directory. Whenever the reviewer feels the need to consult the full text, the record must be ticked.

* ‚ö° (Unicode 4.0 High Voltage Sign), an impression that the record may be useful to answer the clinical question under review, and to clear this up, one has to look up the abstract at least, or the full text if needed;
* üëç (Unicode 6.0 Thumbs Up Sign), the record may definitely be useful to answer the clinical question under review, which is clear either right from the title or after having looked at the abstract or even the full texts;
* üèÜ (Unicode 6.0 Trophy), the winning papers that, to a great degree, are dedicated to answering the clinical question under review, which has become clear one way or the other.

There usually is just one screener. Even though it has been repeatedly shown single screening is associated with significantly higher miss rates (as high as one per every ten to one per every five eligible records), it is the best available option given the RESCUER format.

## 10 Data charting process‚Ä°: Describe the methods of charting data from the included sources of evidence (e.g., calibrated forms or forms that have been tested by the team before their use, and whether data charting was done independently or in duplicate) and any processes for obtaining and confirming data from investigators



## 11 Data items: List and define all variables for which data were sought and any assumptions and simplifications made



## 12 Critical appraisal of individual sources of evidence¬ß: If done, provide a rationale for conducting a critical appraisal of included sources of evidence; describe the methods used and how this information was used in any data synthesis (if appropriate)



## 13 Synthesis of results: Describe the methods of handling and summarizing the data that were charted



# RESULTS

## 14 Selection of sources of evidence: Give numbers of sources of evidence screened, assessed for eligibility, and included in the review, with reasons for exclusions at each stage, ideally using a flow diagram

Using all the screening tables in the `screening` directory as well as the `bib-` directories bib counts, these calculations are to be run:

* how many records were retrieved per each search query and of them, how many screened,
* per each search query, how many were screened-out definitively based on their title or abstract (unticked),
* how many were screened-in as high-voltage (arguable), thumbs-up (likely relevant), or trophy (definitely relevant),
* of those screened-in per each screening category, how many were eventually charted and how many not, grouped by exclusion reason where feasible.

## 15 Characteristics of sources of evidence: For each source of evidence, present characteristics for which data were charted and provide the citations



## 16 Critical appraisal within sources of evidence: If done, present data on critical appraisal of included sources of evidence (see item 12)



## 17 Results of individual sources of evidence: For each included source of evidence, present the relevant data that were charted that relate to the review questions and objectives



## 18 Synthesis of results: Summarize and/or present the charting results as they relate to the review questions and objectives



# DISCUSSION

## 19 Summary of evidence: Summarize the main results (including an overview of concepts, themes, and types of evidence available), link to the review questions and objectives, and consider the relevance to key groups



## 20 Limitations: Discuss the limitations of the scoping review process



## 21 Conclusions: Provide a general interpretation of the results with respect to the review questions and objectives, as well as potential implications and/or next steps



# FUNDING

## 22 Funding: Describe sources of funding for the included sources of evidence, as well as sources of funding for the scoping review. Describe the role of the funders of the scoping review

See the COI file.

# PRISMA-ScR checklist footnotes

JBI = Joanna Briggs Institute; PRISMA-ScR = Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews.

* Where sources of evidence (see second footnote) are compiled from, such as bibliographic databases, social media platforms, and Web sites.

‚Ä† A more inclusive/heterogeneous term used to account for the different types of evidence or data sources (e.g., quantitative and/or qualitative research, expert opinion, and policy documents) that may be eligible in a scoping review as opposed to only studies. This is not to be confused with information sources (see first footnote).

‚Ä° The frameworks by Arksey and O‚ÄôMalley (6) and Levac and colleagues (7) and the JBI guidance (4, 5) refer to the process of data extraction in a scoping review as data charting.

¬ß The process of systematically examining research evidence to assess its validity, results, and relevance before using it to inform a decision. This term is used for items 12 and 19 instead of "risk of bias" (which is more applicable to systematic reviews of interventions) to include and acknowledge the various sources of evidence that may be used in a scoping review (e.g., quantitative and/or qualitative research, expert opinion, and policy document).
