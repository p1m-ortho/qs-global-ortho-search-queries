	abstract = {AIM: Secondary femur fracture subsequent to treatment of trochanteric fractures with cephalomedullary nailing (i.e., a periprosthetic fracture related to the cephalomedullary nail) is a rare but very severe complication. As such, the aim of this study was to assess the impact of revision surgery and general state of health on mortality and functional outcomes in patients suffering femur fractures following treatment with cephalomedullary nails.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between 2000 and 2015, 3549 patients presenting with OTA/AO 31A1-3 femur fractures were admitted to our department and subsequently treated with either a Gamma® Nail or PFNA®. Out of this sample population, 42 patients suffered 43 secondary femur shaft fractures (1.2\%). The mean follow-up time was 26 ± 9.7 months. Fractures were classified according to the AO classification and the modified Vancouver classification. Treatment options included ORIF, removing the cephalomedullary nail and fixation with a long nail with or without cerclage wires. General health status was defined according to the ASA Score. Mortality, pre- and postoperative mobility, hospital stay and complications were assessed retrospectively.
RESULTS: A total of 14.3\% patients died within 90 days following surgery. At least 16.6\% patients died due to medical complications strongly related to the surgery. The average time to secondary fracture following initial surgery for trochanteric fracture was 122.7 ± 32 weeks. The most common fracture types were AO 32A1 (53.5\%) and AO 32B1 (23.3), as well as Vancouver C and B1. A time-to-secondary-fracture of less than or longer than 6 months following surgery for trochanteric fracture and ASA Score all had no significant influence on mortality, complications, duration of surgery and postoperative mobility.
CONCLUSION: Femoral shaft facture subsequent to fixation of trochanteric fracture with cephalomedullary nails is a severe complication. It leads to prolonged hospital stays and delayed recovery. Postoperative hospital stay mortality rates may be as high as 16.6\%.},
