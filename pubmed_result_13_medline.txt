TI  - Negative Cognitions Prior to Trauma Predict Acute Posttraumatic Stress Disorder
      Symptomatology.

AB  - Based on emotional processing theory, preexisting negative cognitions may
      contribute to the development of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms.
      The present study prospectively examined the association between preexisting
      PTSD-related cognitions and subsequent acute PTSD symptoms, and the potential
      mediators of this association. We also compared the effect of preexisting
      depressive cognitions and preexisting PTSD-related cognitions on PTSD symptoms.
      In the current study, 810 Taiwanese undergraduates completed a baseline survey
      (T1), of which 73.1% (n = 592) participated in a second survey two months later
      (T2). Of those who completed both surveys, 97 experienced a trauma at least one
      week before T2; this group comprised the final sample. Hierarchical regression
      showed that preexisting PTSD-related cognitions (beta = .38, p < .001, sr(2) =
      .117), but not preexisting depressive cognitions (beta = .11, p = .315, sr(2) =
      .011), were a significant and substantial predictor of acute PTSD symptoms after 
      we controlled for established pretrauma risk factors (i.e., gender, prior trauma,
      and prior psychological problems). Multiple mediation analysis revealed that
      negative appraisal of symptoms (a1 b1 = 0.90, 95% CI [0.16, 2.18], PM = .251) and
      trauma-related rumination (a3 b3 = 1.23, 95% CI [0.23, 2.86], PM = .341), but not
      trauma memory disorganization (a2 b2 = 0.65, 95% CI [-0.17, 1.92], PM = .182),
      significantly mediated between preexisting PTSD-related cognitions and acute PTSD
      symptoms. Our findings highlight the role of preexisting negative cognitions in
      acute PTSD symptomatology. The development of PTSD symptoms is likely determined 
      by the interaction of risk factors before and after trauma.

PG  - 12S-16S
LID - 10.1177/2192568216687546 [doi]
AB  - STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective multi-institutional case series. OBJECTIVE: The
      anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF) affords the surgeon the
      flexibility to treat a variety of cervical pathologies, with the majority being
      for degenerative and traumatic indications. Limited data in the literature
      describe the presentation and true incidence of postoperative surgical site
      infections. METHODS: A retrospective multicenter case series study was conducted 
      involving 21 high-volume surgical centers from the AOSpine North America Clinical
      Research Network, selected for their excellence in spine care and clinical
      research infrastructure and experience. Medical records for 17 625 patients who
      received cervical spine surgery (levels from C2 to C7) between January 1, 2005,
      and December 31, 2011, inclusive, were reviewed to identify the occurrence of 21 
      predefined treatment complications. Patients who underwent an ACDF were
      identified in the database and reviewed for the occurrence of postoperative
      anterior cervical infections. RESULTS: A total of 8887 patients were identified
      from a retrospective database analysis of 21 centers providing data for
      postoperative anterior cervical infections (17/21, 81% response rate). A total of
      6 postoperative infections after ACDF were identified for a mean rate of 0.07%
      (range 0% to 0.39%). The mean age of patients identified was 57.5 (SD = 11.6,
      66.7% female). The mean body mass index was 22.02. Of the total infections, half 
      were smokers (n = 3). Two patients presented with myelopathy, and 3 patients
      presented with radiculopathic-type complaints. The mean length of stay was 4.7
      days. All patients were treated aggressively with surgery for management of this 
      complication, with improvement in all patients. There were no mortalities.
      CONCLUSION: The incidence of postoperative infection in ACDF is exceedingly low. 
      The management has historically been urgent irrigation and debridement of the
      surgical site. However, due to the rarity of this occurrence, guidance for
      management is limited to retrospective series.

TI  - Comparison of Three Surgical Approaches for Thoracic Spinal Tuberculosis in
      Adult: Minimum 5-Year Follow Up.
PG  - 808-817
LID - 10.1097/BRS.0000000000001955 [doi]
AB  - STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective study. OBJECTIVE: To assess the minimum 5-year follow
      up outcomes of the surgical management of adults with thoracic tuberculosis by
      comparing posterior only (PO), anterior only (AO), and combined posterior and
      anterior (AP) surgical approaches. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Surgeons use
      multiple methods to treat spinal tuberculosis, including an anterior, posterior, 
      and combined anterior and posterior approach. However, there are a few reports
      comparing the mid- and long-term outcomes of these surgical methods. METHODS: The
      medical records for 184 patients treated for thoracic tuberculosis between
      January 2003 and November 2010 were retrospectively reviewed. Among them, 62
      patients were treated with a single-stage posterior debridement and interbody
      fusion with instrumentation (Group A), 65 patients with posterior
      instrumentation, anterior debridement, and bone graft in a single or two-stage
      procedure (Group B), and 57 patients with anterior debridement and strut grafting
      with instrumentation (Group C). Operative time, blood loss, Visual Analog Scale
      for pain, complications, recovery of neurological function, Cobb angle,
      correction rate, and loss angle were compared among all groups. RESULTS: Groups
      A, B, and C were followed for 72.7 +/- 3.8 months, 74.3 +/- 4.2 months, and 73.6 
      +/- 4.5 months, respectively. The operative time, blood loss, and rate of
      complications for Group A were significantly less than Groups B and C (P < 0.05).
      The correction rate and loss angle were superior in Groups A and B compared with 
      C, whereas the Visual Analog Scale for pain and fusion time showed no
      statistically significant difference among the groups (P > 0.05). CONCLUSION: For
      patients with thoracic tuberculosis, use of the AO approach should be limited.
      Although the AP approach produced satisfactory outcomes, it remains more
      traumatic. Therefore, the PO approach is recommended, not only because it
      achieves good results, but because it has reduced complications, operative time, 
      and blood loss. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 3.

PG  - 100
LID - 10.1186/s13018-015-0238-0 [doi]
AB  - STUDY DESIGN: This is a retrospective case-control study. OBJECTIVES: The
      surgical approaches to cervicothoracic spinal tuberculosis (CTSTB) were
      controversial. The aim of this research is to retrospectively compare the
      efficacy and feasibility of anterior-only (AO) approach, combined anterior and
      posterior (AP) surgeries, and posterior-only (PO) approach for the treatment of
      CTSTB. METHODS: AO approach was undertaken in 20 patients (group A), AP fusion
      was carried out in 18 patients (group B), and PO surgery was performed in 21
      patients (group C). Surgery duration, intraoperative blood loss, length of
      hospitalization, neurological status, kyphosis angle correction, loss of
      correction, and complications of the three groups were compared. RESULTS: Three
      surgical approaches all improved the kyphosis deformity and neurological function
      significantly (P < 0.05). The mean loss of correction in group A in the final
      follow-up was higher than in groups B and C (P < 0.05), and the difference
      between groups B and C was not significant (P > 0.05). The mean operation time,
      blood loss, and hospitalization days in group B were greater than in groups A and
      C. Complications were most prevalent in group A, more in group B, and the least
      in group C. CONCLUSION: The AO approach surgery should be limitedly used for
      severe CTSTB. The AP approach had got satisfactory clinical and radiographic
      outcomes, but with larger trauma and more complications, which should be
      reservedly performed for mild CTSTB. Compared to traditional surgery, PO surgery 
      can significantly improve clinical results and obviously relieve postoperative
      complications.

TI  - Accounting for sex differences in PTSD: A multi-variable mediation model.
PG  - 26068
LID - 10.3402/ejpt.v6.26068 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Approximately twice as many females as males are diagnosed with
      posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). However, little is known about why females 
      report more PTSD symptoms than males. Prior studies have generally focused on few
      potential mediators at a time and have often used methods that were not ideally
      suited to test for mediation effects. Prior research has identified a number of
      individual risk factors that may contribute to sex differences in PTSD severity, 
      although these cannot fully account for the increased symptom levels in females
      when examined individually. OBJECTIVE: The present study is the first to
      systematically test the hypothesis that a combination of pre-, peri-, and
      posttraumatic risk factors more prevalent in females can account for sex
      differences in PTSD severity. METHOD: The study was a quasi-prospective
      questionnaire survey assessing PTSD and related variables in 73.3% of all Danish 
      bank employees exposed to bank robbery during the period from April 2010 to April
      2011. Participants filled out questionnaires 1 week (T1, N=450) and 6 months
      after the robbery (T2, N=368; 61.1% females). Mediation was examined using an
      analysis designed specifically to test a multiple mediator model. RESULTS:
      Females reported more PTSD symptoms than males and higher levels of neuroticism, 
      depression, physical anxiety sensitivity, peritraumatic fear, horror, and
      helplessness (the A2 criterion), tonic immobility, panic, dissociation, negative 
      posttraumatic cognitions about self and the world, and feeling let down. These
      variables were included in the model as potential mediators. The combination of
      risk factors significantly mediated the association between sex and PTSD
      severity, accounting for 83% of the association. CONCLUSION: The findings suggest
      that females report more PTSD symptoms because they experience higher levels of
      associated risk factors. The results are relevant to other trauma populations and
      to other trauma-related psychiatric disorders more prevalent in females, such as 
      depression and anxiety.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To perform an extensive analysis of journals in Medicine III - CAPES,
      and specifically those in the areas of Otorhinolaryngology, Orthopedics and
      Traumatology and Chest Surgery. METHOD: An active search for the impact factors
      in the Journal Citation Reports, Scimago, their indexation in Scielo, Lilacs,
      Scopus and Google Scholar, and their stratification in WebQualis was done.
      RESULTS: Forty-four journals with measured impact factors ranging from 3.006 to
      0.128 were detected in the area of Otorhinolaryngology; however, only 26 of them 
      (60%) had a Qualis measured by CAPES; in the stratification, no journal was
      detected in A1, three were A2 and nine B1. Three journals were located for Chest 
      Surgery, with only one of them having a measured Qualis (A2) with a mean of 3.61.
      Sixty-seven journals were detected for Orthopedics and Traumatology, with an
      impact factor ranging from 4.699 to 0.156; Qualis was measured in only 38 of them
      (60%); there were three journal stratified as A1, seven as A2 and 25 as B1.
      CONCLUSION: The search for journals of higher impact induces authors to not
      publish in journals related to their area and facing more difficulties than
      investigators from other areas. OBJETIVOS: Realizar analise ampla dos periodicos 
      da Medicina III - CAPES e, especificamente, os pertencentes a
      Otorrinolaringologia, Ortopedia e Traumatologia, e Cirurgia Toracica. METODO:
      Busca ativa do fator de impacto dos periodicos das areas citadas no Journal
      Citation Report e Scimago, sua indexacao no Scielo, Lilacs, Scopus, Google
      Scholar e sua estratificacao no WebQualis. RESULTADOS: Para a
      Otorrinolaringologia foram encontrados 44 periodicos, cujo fator de impacto
      variou de 3.006 a 0.128; entretanto, apenas 26 deles (60%) tinham Qualis medido
      pela CAPES; nas estratificacoes encontrou-se nenhuma revista em A1, tres em A2 e 
      nove em B1. Para a Cirurgia Toracica foram localizados tres periodicos, sendo que
      apenas um tinha Qualis medido (A2) com media de 3.61. Os resultados da busca para
      a Ortopedia e Traumatologia permitiu encontrar 67 periodicos, cuja variacao do
      fator de impacto foi de 4.699 a 0.156; apenas 38 deles (60%) tinham Qualis
      medido; tres periodicos tinham estratificacao A1, sete A2 e 25 em B1. CONCLUSAO: 
      A busca por revistas de maior impacto faz com que muitos especialistas deixem de 
      publicar em revistas de sua area enfrentando mais dificuldades que pesquisadores 
      das outras areas.

TI  - Accuracy and reliability of MRI quantitative measurements to assess spinal cord
      compression in cervical spondylotic myelopathy: a prospective study.
PG  - 56-7
LID - 10.1055/s-0028-1100916 [doi]
AB  - STUDY TYPE: Reliability study Introduction: Cervical spondylotic myelopathy (CSM)
      is the most common spinal cord disorder in persons more than 55 years old.
      Despite multiple neuroimaging approaches proposed to quantify the spinal cord
      compromise in CSM patients, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) remains the
      procedure of choice by providing helpful information for clinical decision
      making, determining optimal subpopulations for treatment, and selecting the
      optimal treatment strategies. However, the validity, reliability, and accuracy of
      the MRI quantitative measurements have not yet been addressed. OBJECTIVE: To
      assess the intra- and inter-observer reliability of MRI quantitative measurements
      of the spinal cord compromise in CSM patients. METHODS: Seventeen CSM patients
      (13 male) of mean age 54.5 years old were selected from the AOSpine North America
      database. The patients had different combinations of stenotic levels (1-4 levels)
      and the clinical severity (range mJOA baseline: 8-18). Asymptomatic or previous
      surgically treated CSM, active infection, neoplastic disease, rheumatoid
      arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, trauma, or concomitant lumbar stenosis were
      excluded. The patients underwent preoperative MRI using 1.5T (15 patients) and 3T
      (two patients) scanner, including mid-sagittal T1-weighted, axial and
      mid-sagittal T2-weighted series. MRI data were analyzed (Mango 2.0 software;
      Multi-Image Analysis GUI) by four blind raters in three different sessions. Four 
      measurements were analysed: transverse area (TA) (Figure 1), compression ratio
      (CR) (Figure 2), maximal canal compromise (MCC), and maximal spinal cord
      compression (MSCC) (Figure 3). The differences for each measurement were
      evaluated using mixed-effect ANOVA models (ratter, session, ratter x session).
      The intra- and inter-rater reliability was evaluated with intraclass correlation 
      coefficients (ICC) (Figure 4). Figure 1 Transverse area (TA)Figure 2 Compression 
      ratio (CR = AP/W)Figure 3 Maximal canal compromise (MCC), and maximal spinal cord
      compression (MSCC). MCC(%) = 1-[Dx/(Da+Db)/2] x 100%; MSCC(%) = 1-[dx/(da+db)/2] 
      x 100%Figure 4 Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) Results: The principal
      findings were: (i) for TA (71.48 +/- 12.99mm2), the intra-rater agreement was
      0.97 (95% CI, range 0.94-0.99) and the inter-rater agreement was 0.76 (95% CI,
      range 0.49-0.90); (ii) for CR (0.35 +/- 0.04%), 0.94 (95% CI, range 0.88-0.98),
      and 0.79 (95% CI, range 0.57-0.91) respectively; (iii) for MCC (83.21 +/- 2.08%),
      0.95 (95% CI, range 0.89-0.98), and 0.64 (95% CI, range 0.28-0.85) respectively; 
      and (iv) for MSCC (82.87 +/- 1.52%), 0.93 (95% CI, range 0.86-0.97), and 0.84
      (95% CI, range 0.65-0.93) respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that three 
      out of four measurements (TA, CR and MSCC) have acceptable intra- and
      interreliability coefficients (ICC > 0.75). However, for the maximal canal
      compromise measure, although the intrareliability was acceptable, the inter-rater
      reliability was not acceptable (0.64). Based on this study, we recommend that
      three MRI measures: transverse area, compression ratio and maximal spinal cord
      compression should be used in the imaging assessment of the spinal cord in CSM
      patients.

TI  - Harmful drinking in military veterans with post-traumatic stress disorder:
      association with the D2 dopamine receptor A1 allele.
PG  - 451-6
AB  - AIMS: The frequency of the Taq I A alleles (A1 and A2) of the D2 dopamine
      receptor (DRD2) gene was examined in Caucasian post-traumatic stress disorder
      (PTSD) patients and controls. RESULTS: In 91 PTSD patients, the frequency of the 
      A1 allele was higher (P = 6.12 x 10(-3)) than in the 51 controls. In the 38 PTSD 
      harmful drinkers (>or=60 g alcohol/day), A1 allelic frequency was higher (P =
      3.91 x 10(-2)) than in the 53 non-harmful drinkers (<60 g alcohol/day), the
      former being also higher (P = 3.76 x 10(-4)) than in controls. However, there was
      no difference between non-harmful drinkers and controls. Based on DRD2 allelic
      association, the 35 PTSD patients with the A1(+) (A1A1, A1A2) allele consumed
      more than twice the daily amount of alcohol than the 56 patients with the A1(-)
      (A2A2) allele (P = 1.94 x 10(-3)). When the hourly rate of alcohol consumed was
      compared, A1(+) allelic patients consumed twice the rate of the A1(-) allelic
      patients (P < 10(-7)). CONCLUSION: The DRD2 A1 allele was associated with PTSD.
      However, this association was found only in the harmful drinkers. PTSD patients
      with the A1(+) allele consumed more alcohol than patients with the A1(-) allele. 
      The importance of determining alcohol consumption in DRD2 association studies
      with PTSD is suggested.

TI  - Muscular trauma treated with a ga-Al-as diode laser: in vivo experimental study.
PG  - 293-8
LID - 10.1007/s101030050011 [doi]
AB  - The aim of the study was to verify in an experimental model the effects of laser 
      therapy performed with Ga-Al-As diode lasers (780 nm, 2500 mW) on traumatised
      muscles. Forty adult New Zealand male rabbits were divided into four groups (A,
      B, C and D) of ten animals each. Each group of animals was further divided into
      two subgroups of five animals each. The animals were submitted to muscular trauma
      for 7 min by clamping the posterior muscles of the left thigh under general
      anaesthesia. Four days later, the rabbits in the B1, B2, C1, C2, D1 and D2
      subgroups started daily laser therapy. The parameters utilised were: 150 J/cm(2) 
      energy density, 3 W, 50 Hz in group B; 250 J/cm(2), 3 W, 100 Hz in group C; and
      800 J/cm(2), 3 W, 0 Hz (continuous output) in group D. The animals in subgroups
      A1 and A2 were used as untreated controls and allowed to heal spontaneously. In
      order to prepare samples for histological, histochemical and histomorphometrical 
      studies, dissection of the posterior muscle of the thigh was performed under
      general anaesthesia and before sacrifice, after five days of laser therapy in the
      subgroups B1, C1 and D1 and after ten days of laser therapy in subgroups B2, C2
      and D2. The samples of untreated subgroups A1 and A2 were subjected to the same
      procedure and at the same times as the corresponding laser-treated groups. The
      following parameters were analysed on muscular samples: qualitative histological 
      aspect (lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), cytochrome oxidase, acid phosphatase and
      alkaline phosphatase concentration with histoenzymatic methods) and quantitative 
      histomorphometric evaluation of muscular damage and tissue repair. Blood samples 
      were drawn from each subgroup before the trauma and again before sacrifice to
      measure the creatine phosphokinase (CK) and LDH levels. The results obtained in
      the tables are shown. Analysis of the results showed a better qualitative and
      quantitative healing process in traumatised muscles treated with Ga-Al-As diode
      laser therapy than in spontaneously healed ones. The results obtained with laser 
      therapy were confirmed as haematic, histoenzymatic and histomorphometric values. 
      According to these results, there is a positive relationship between the
      biostimulation properties of the laser and the healing of traumatised muscular
      tissue.

TI  - A study of the effects of extracorporeal circulation on the immunologic system of
      humans.
PG  - 893-8
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The objectives of this study were to quantify the immunosuppressive
      effects of cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) and to identify mechanisms responsible
      for the postoperative immunosuppression of patients undergoing cardiac surgery.
      DESIGN: A prospective study from 20 consecutive patients. SETTING: The same team 
      operated on all patients in a major teaching hospital, and the immunologic tests 
      were performed in the hospital's hematology laboratory. PARTICIPANTS: Twenty
      patients were studied who had consented to participate in the study.
      INTERVENTIONS: All patients underwent valve replacement under general anesthesia.
      MEASUREMENT AND MAIN RESULTS: The changes in the white blood cell count (WBC), in
      the B, T, T4, T8 lymphocytes, the concentrations of C-reactive protein (CRP),
      a1-antitrypsin (A1AT), a2-macroglobulin (A2MG), C3, C4 immunoglobulin A (IgA),
      IgM, IgG, Kappa (K), and lambda (L) chains were studied. The postoperative immune
      response was expressed with (1) increased mean axillary temperature (37.5 degrees
      +/- 0.62 degrees) in the first postoperative 24 hours; (2) increase of WBC (p <
      0.001) and T8 (p < 0.01); (3) reduction of C3 (p = 0.01) and A2MG (p < 0.01); (4)
      reduction of IgA (p < 0.001) and IgG, K, L chains (p < 0.01); and (5) reduction
      of T (p < 0.01) and T4 (p < 0.01). In the first 24 hours postoperatively, B cells
      were increased (81%) together with CRP (p < 0.01) and A1AT. CONCLUSIONS: The
      observed immune alterations were mostly of no immunologic origin and were related
      to hemodilution and inflammation together with an immunosuppressive effect of
      trauma and stress.

TI  - Reduced inflammatory response in minimal invasive surgery of pneumothorax.
PG  - 1079-82
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To elucidate whether thoracoscopy for surgical therapy of pneumothorax
      leads to a reduction of inflammatory responses in comparison with standard
      thoracotomy. DESIGN: A prospective randomized study PATIENTS: Eleven patients (9 
      men and 2 women; median age, 28 years; range, 21-44 years) were treated by
      thoracotomy; 10 patients (9 men and 1 woman; median age, 26 years; range, 21-28
      years) were managed thoracoscopically. The plasma concentrations of the following
      were determined: polymorphonuclear granulocyte elastase and C-reactive protein as
      inflammatory parameters and prostanoids (prostacyclin, thromboxane A2,
      prostaglandin F2 alpha, prostaglandin M, and prostaglandin E2) as vasoactive
      parameters. Blood sampling was performed perioperatively and on day 3 after
      surgery. RESULTS: The thoracoscopy group revealed a shorter hospital stay (5 vs 7
      days; P < .05) and a significantly reduced need for intravenous pain medication
      within 48 hours (1 vs 3 requirements; P < .01) vs the thoracotomy group. The
      release of inflammatory (C-reactive protein, P < .01) and vasoactive
      (prostacyclin and thromboxane A2, P < .01) mediators was less during thoracoscopy
      compared with standard thoracotomy. CONCLUSIONS: The thoracoscopic procedure is
      less invasive when performing wedge resection of apical blebs. With intracavitary
      management being equivalent to the conventional technique, the curtailed
      morbidity after thoracoscopic surgery is considered to be related to the minimal 
      trauma associated with the access to lung tissue and the reduced handling of lung
      tissue.

TI  - Application and results of the AO internal fixation system in nontraumatic
      indications.
PG  - S162-9
AB  - The AO internal skeletal fixation system (ISFS) permits posterior spine fixation 
      to be restricted to the vertebrae immediately adjacent to the lesion and allows
      manipulation of each instrumented vertebra in three planes. In a prospective
      study to assess the value of this fixation for adult spinal disorders, 68
      patients were reviewed. The device was used in spondylolisthesis, postlaminectomy
      instability, post-traumatic kyphosis, degenerative scoliosis, spinal stenosis,
      tumors, and infections. A total of 322 transpedicular screws have been inserted
      without neurologic complication. Satisfactory results were achieved in 88% of the
      patients, and only four pseudarthroses (6%) occurred. The ISFS provides rigid
      stabilization to enhance bone graft consolidation and to allow rapid
      postoperative mobilization in a light external orthosis.

TI  - Lipoxygenase products: leukotrienes C4, D4, A4's breakdown products and 12-HPETE 
      influence platelet aggregation in vivo.
PG  - 459-65
AB  - Clinical and pathological observations of diseases concomitant which leukotriene 
      release show consistently an involvement of platelet activation. This effect was 
      hitherto believed to be due to tissue trauma. The aim of the present study was to
      elucidate whether lipoxygenase products such as leukotrienes C4, D4, 12-HPETE and
      the breakdown products of leukotriene A4 have a direct pro-aggregatory property
      of their own. Platelet aggregation was induced by intravascular excitation of
      fluoresceiniso-thiocyanate-dextran in arterioles of the hamster cheek pouch.
      "Time to aggregate appearance" was assessed prior and after parenteral
      application of the studied compounds. LTA4's breakdown products were found to
      have anti-aggregatory properties, whereas LTC4, D4 and 12-HPETE enhanced platelet
      aggregability.
