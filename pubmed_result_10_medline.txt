TI  - Treatment Effect or Effective Treatment? Cardiac Compression Fraction and
      End-tidal Carbon Dioxide Are Higher in Patients Resuscitative Endovascular
      Balloon Occlusion of the Aorta Compared with Resuscitative Thoracotomy and
      Open-Chest Cardiac Massage.
PG  - 1691-1695
AB  - The purpose of this study is to compare end-tidal carbon dioxide (EtCO(2)) during
      resuscitation of open-chest cardiac massage (OCCM) with aortic cross-clamp (ACC) 
      versus receiving resuscitative endovascular balloon occlusion of the aorta
      (REBOA) with closed-chest compressions (CCCs). Patients who received REBOA were
      compared with patients receiving OCCM for traumatic arrest using continuous vital
      sign monitoring and videography. Thirty-three patients were enrolled in the REBOA
      group and 18 patients were enrolled in the OCCM group. Of the total patients,
      86.3 per cent were male with a mean age of 36.2 +/- 13.9 years. Ninety-four
      percent of patients suffered penetrating trauma in the OCCM group compared with
      30.3 per cent of the REBOA group (P = <0.001). Before aortic occlusion (AO),
      there was no difference in initial EtCO(2) values, but mean, median, peak, and
      final EtCO(2) values were lower in OCCM (P < 0.005). During CPR after AO, the
      initial, mean, and median values were higher with REBOA (P = 0.015, 0.036, and
      0.038). The rate of return of spontaneous circulation was higher in REBOA versus 
      OCCM (20/33 [60.1%] vs 5/18 [33.3%]; P = 0.04), and REBOA patients survived to
      operative intervention more frequently (P = 0.038). REBOA patients had greater
      total cardiac compression fraction (CCF) before AO than OCCM (85.3 +/- 12.7% vs
      35.2 +/- 18.6%, P < 0.0001) and after AO (88.3 +/- 7.8% vs 71.9 +/- 24.4%, P =
      0.0052). REBOA patients have higher EtCO(2) and cardiac compression fraction
      before and after AO compared with patients who receive OCCM.

TI  - Universal disease-specific outcome instruments for spine trauma: a global
      perspective on relevant parameters to evaluate clinical and functional outcomes
      of thoracic and lumbar spine trauma patients.
PG  - 1541-1549
LID - 10.1007/s00586-016-4596-z [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Besides a patient reported outcome measure, the AOSpine Knowledge Forum 
      Trauma aims to develop a new concept of a surgeon reported outcome measure (SROM)
      for spine trauma patients. This study aims to identify parameters that spine
      surgeons consider relevant to evaluate clinical and functional outcomes of
      thoracic and lumbar spine trauma patients. METHODS: An international
      cross-sectional web-based survey was conducted among spine surgeons from the five
      AOSpine International world regions. They were asked to evaluate the relevance of
      a compilation of 16 clinical and radiological parameters for thoracic and lumbar 
      spine trauma patients, both for the short term (3 months-2 years) and long term
      (>/=2 years), on a five-point scale. The responses were analyzed using
      descriptive statistics, frequency analysis, and Kruskal-Wallis test. RESULTS: Out
      of the 279 invited members of AOSpine International and the International Spinal 
      Cord Society, 118 (42.3 %) participated in this study. Of the 16 surveyed
      parameters, 5 were identified as relevant by at least 70 % of the participants.
      Neurological status was identified as most relevant. In contrast, five parameters
      were not deemed relevant for any spine region or time period, except for
      comorbidity. Only minor differences were observed when analyzing the responses
      according to each world region, spine surgeons' clinical experience, or
      professional background. CONCLUSIONS: Including a large and representative sample
      of spine trauma experts, this study identified parameters to evaluate clinical
      and functional outcomes of thoracic and lumbar spine trauma patients. The results
      form the basis for the development of a SROM for this specific patient
      population.

TI  - Sinonasal epithelial wound resealing in an in vitro model: inhibition of wound
      closure with IL-4 exposure.
PG  - 439-49
LID - 10.1002/alr.21158 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Prolonged healing and persistent inflammation following surgery for
      rhinosinusitis impacts patient satisfaction and healthcare resources. Cytokines
      interleukin (IL)-4, IL-5, and IL-13 are important mediators in T-helper 2 (Th2)
      inflammatory rhinosinusitis. Decreased wound healing has been demonstrated with
      Th2 cytokine exposure, but this has not been extensively studied in sinonasal
      epithelium. We hypothesized that in vitro exposure of primary sinonasal
      epithelial cell cultures to Th2 inflammatory cytokine IL-4 and IL-13 would impair
      wound resealing and decrease expression of annexin A2 at the wound edge. METHODS:
      Following 24-hour exposure to IL-4, IL-5, or IL-13 vs controls, sterile linear
      mechanical wounds were created in primary sinonasal epithelial cultures (n = 12
      wounds per condition). Wounds were followed for 36 hours or until complete
      closure, and residual wound areas were calculated by image analysis. Group
      differences in annexin A2 were assessed by immunofluorescence labeling, confocal 
      microscopy, and Western blots. RESULTS: Significant wound closure differences
      were identified across cytokine exposure groups (p < 0.001). Mean percentage
      wound closure at the completion of the 36-hour time course was 98.41% +/- 3.43%
      for control wounds vs 85.02% +/- 18.46% for IL-4 exposed wounds. IL-13 did not
      significantly impair sinonasal epithelial wound resealing in vitro. Annexin A2
      protein levels were decreased in IL-4 treated wounds when compared to control
      wounds (p < 0.01). CONCLUSION: Th2 cytokine IL-4 decreases sinonasal epithelial
      wound closure in vitro. Annexin A2 is also diminished with IL-4 exposure. This
      supports the hypothesis that IL-4 exposure impairs sinonasal epithelial wound
      healing and may contribute to prolonged healing in Th2 inflammatory
      rhinosinusitis.

TI  - [Anatomical course of the chorda tympani nerve in middle ear surgery: clinical
      classification and relevance for postoperative gustatory dysfunction].
PG  - 592-8
LID - 10.1055/s-0029-1214393 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The anatomical course of the Chorda tympani nerve (CTN) in the middle
      ear is known to be very variable, which becomes most obvious during middle ear
      operations. As well, postoperative gustatory dysfunction belongs to the most
      frequent complications after otosurgical interventions. The aim of this study was
      to develop a clinical classification of the intraoperatively visible course of
      the CTN and to demonstrate a possible correlation of its anatomic course with the
      prevalence of actual postoperative taste disorders. METHODS: Only cases of
      first-time ear surgery all operated by one experienced otosurgeon were assessed. 
      Preoperatively, gustatory testing with standardised chemical solutions (sweet,
      sour, salty, bitter) was performed. During surgery the course of the CTN was
      classified at first sight by 3 topografical criteria: The angle (A), the height
      (H) and the depth (D) of the nerve's emergence from the lateral tympanic wall. In
      cases of postoperative taste dysfunction the patients were followed-up on a
      regular basis. RESULTS: 103 patients were included in the study. The angle of the
      nerve;s emergence from the tympanic bone was below 30 degrees in 59 (A1), between
      30 degrees and 60 degrees in 41 (A2) and within 60 degrees and 90 degrees in 3
      cases (A3). The height of emergence was 33 times in the superior (H1), 61 times
      in the middle (H2) and 9 times in the inferior third (H3) of the posterior meatal
      wall. The depth of emergence lay within the plain of the tympanic sulcus in 26
      individuals (D1), 44 times medially to this plain without overlapping bone (D2)
      and 33 times medially but covered by a bony spur (D3). The CTN was preserved in
      92 procedures. Postoperatively, gustatory function was diminished in 7% of the
      cases. CONCLUSION: This study confirms the high diversity of the surgical anatomy
      of the CTN. According to the proposed classification the A1-H1-D2/3-situation
      belongs to the CTN-constellations observed most frequently. It is this very
      anatomical situation, that apparently tends to be associated with postoperative
      taste deficits quite regularly due to inevitable intraoperative manipulations.
      Taking into account the results of this study an otosurgeon might be able to
      anticipate the potential risk for the CTN by judging the AHD-status
      intraoperatively and - therefore - reduce taste disorders postoperatively.
      Additionally, the probability of a postoperative gustatory dysfunction depends
      upon the kind of underlying middle ear disease as well.

TI  - Finger A2 pulley lesions in rock climbers: detection and characterization with
      magnetic resonance imaging at 3 Tesla--initial results.
PG  - 435-41
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at 3 T in the diagnosis 
      and characterization of lesions of the finger flexor A2 pulley in patients with
      clinically suspected A2 pulley lesions. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eight consecutive 
      patients with clinically suspected lesions of the A2 pulley were included in this
      retrospective study. 3 T MRI was performed with T1-weighted, T2-weighted fat
      suppressed, and T1-weighted fat suppressed contrast enhanced sequences. The A2
      pulley of all the fingers visible on the images were analyzed and pulley lesions 
      characterized. RESULTS: All asymptomatic pulleys were normal at MRI. In the 8
      symptomatic fingers 7 pulleys were abnormal at MRI. With the clinical examination
      as gold standard, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and
      negative predictive value of MRI were 87.5%, 100%, 100%, and 95.2% respectively. 
      Characterization of the different pulley lesion was possible. CONCLUSION: MRI at 
      3 T allows reliable direct visualization and characterization of traumatic A2
      pulley lesions.

TI  - Surgical trauma: hyperinflammation versus immunosuppression?
PG  - 475-84
AB  - BACKGROUND: Experimental and clinical studies have brought evidence that surgical
      trauma markedly affects the immune system, including both the specific and the
      non-specific immune response. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This report reviews the
      present knowledge on the mechanisms of surgical trauma-induced immune dysfunction
      and outlines experimental and clinical approaches to find effective treatment
      strategies. RESULTS: Major surgical trauma induces an early hyperinflammatory
      response, which is characterized by (1) pro-inflammatory tumour necrosis factor
      alpha (TNF), interleukin (IL)-1, and IL-6 cytokine release and (2) neutrophil
      activation and microvascular adherence, as well as (3) uncontrolled
      polymorphonuclear (PMN) and macrophage oxidative burst. The massive and
      continuous IL-6 release induces an acute phase response, but, more importantly,
      also accounts for the up-regulation of major anti-inflammatory mediators, such as
      prostaglandin (PG) E2, IL-10 and transforming growth factor (TGF)-ss. This
      results in surgical, trauma-induced, immunosuppression, as indicated by (1)
      monocyte deactivation, reflected by the lack of monocytic TNF- production upon
      lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation, and (2) a shift of the Th1/Th2 ratio
      towards a Th2-dominated cytokine pattern. The imbalance between pro-inflammatory 
      and anti-inflammatory cytokines and immuno-competent cells determines the
      phenotype of disease and should help the physician to compose the therapeutic
      strategy. In fact, recent clinical studies have shown that both the initial
      uncontrolled hyperinflammation and the continued cell-mediated immunosuppression 
      represent primary targets to counteract post-surgery immune dysfunction. The
      balance between inflammatory and anti-inflammatory forces may be restored by
      interferon gamma (IFN-gamma) to counteract monocyte deactivation; the
      anti-inflammatory PGE2 may be inhibited by indomethacin to attenuate
      immunosuppression; or the initial hyperinflammation may be targeted by
      administration of anti-inflammatory substances, such as granulocyte
      colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), hydoxyethyl starch, or pentoxifylline.
      CONCLUSIONS: When drawing up the therapeutic regimen the physician should not
      consider hyperinflammation versus immunosuppression, but hyperinflammation and
      immunosuppression, aiming at restoring an appropriate mediator- and immune
      cell-associated balance.

TI  - The external spinal fixator does not reduce anterior column motion under axial
      compressive loads. A mechanical in vitro study.
PG  - 37-41
AB  - We performed an in vitro study to investigate the effect of external spinal
      fixation on anterior column motion under physiological axial compression loading.
      The AO external spinal fixator (ESF) was applied to 5 human cadaveric lumbar
      spine specimens (L3-S1) at levels L4 to S1. All specimens were tested in 4
      configurations: i) intact, ii) ESF in a neutral position, iii) ESF in distraction
      (12 mm), and iv) ESF in compression (8-12 mm). Cyclic sinusoidal axial
      compressive loads from 60 to 600 N were applied for 10 cycles in each test
      condition. The axial displacement of the load application point was recorded as
      an indicator of anterior column axial translation. The axial motion with the
      fixator in distraction was significantly greater than all other conditions,
      including intact. Compression of the fixator resulted in the least axial
      displacement. External fixation in the neutral position did not significantly
      affect the overall axial translation, when compared to the intact state. In
      conclusion, the external spinal fixator did not significantly reduce anterior
      column axial translation and, in distraction, this motion exceeded that of the
      intact specimen. Since pain relief is frequently observed during distraction of
      the painful segment/s with the external fixator, the mechanical basis of the pain
      relief is not well understood.

TI  - Biomechanical testing of a new design for Schanz pedicle screws.
PG  - 375-80
AB  - Standard 5-mm AO Schanz pedicle screws were biomechanically compared with a new
      design, featuring 6-mm threads with a 5-mm core diameter continuous with the
      shaft. One each of the two screw designs was surgically inserted into the
      matching pedicles of 32 cadaveric vertebrae. The pull-out strengths of the screws
      were then determined by recording the peak force values during extraction under
      servohydraulic displacement control. The screws were also tested in three-point
      bending, varying the inner load point with respect to the shaft thread junction, 
      within a clinically anticipated range. The mean pull-out strength for the 6-mm
      screw was 597 N, which was significantly greater than the mean strength of 405 N 
      for the 5 mm screw (p = 0.002). The 6-mm screw was also stronger in three-point
      bending, and failed at the point of inner load application, with no evidence of a
      stress-raising effect at the shaft/thread junction. In contrast, the 5-mm screw
      withstood lower loads, and failed at the shaft/thread junction, regardless of the
      point of loading. Pedicle screw breakage and pull-out are the recognized modes of
      failure of spinal implants, which are dependent on pedicle screw fixation. The
      results suggest distinct biomechanical advantages for the 6-mm screw, which
      should be used whenever clinically feasible.
