> I have already started appraisal of this article and have found there is evidence that this study is duplicate research. Therefore, assessing comprehensively the problem in question will not be limited to assessing this study only and will take considerable time and effort. I will complete the appraisal as soon as I’m able to. Please return sometime later or follow the progress of this page here or on [GitHub](https://github.com/drzhelnov/zheln.github.io/commits/master/{{ page.path }}) as I do the appraisal. Also, you can look for similar systematic review appraisals using [search](/search/) or by tapping on [AMA specialty tags](/browse/) at the bottom of this page or in the side menu.
