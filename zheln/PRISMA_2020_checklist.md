# INTRODUCTION

## 3 Rationale: Describe the rationale for the review in the context of existing knowledge

Currently ([Papes 2020][Papes2020e13301]) and for more than 10 years now ([Bastian 2010][Bastian2010e1000326]), a wide gap has been recognized between the fast pace research is published and the limited capacity of evidence-based practitioners to promptly process it while also separating the practice-changing wheat from the chaff ([Contou 2020][Contou202070]). And, to my utmost disappointment, it is in contrast to a variety of solutions available ([Bougioukas 2020][Bougioukas2020e12318]) that the call for a dramatic change is out in 2020 ([Boutron 2020][Boutron2020135142]).

Systematic reviews represent a means of tackling the problem ([Page 2020][Page2020gwdhk]). However, they, too, are overwhelming, having given rise to _preappraised evidence summaries_ ([Haynes 2006][Haynes2006162164]). There are many resources that provide this service: [ACP Journal Club](https://www.acpjournals.org/topic/category/journal-club), [Cochrane Clinical Answers](https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cca), now legacy [DARE](https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/crdweb/ShowRecord.asp?ID=32004000332&ID=32004000332) summaries, and [L·OVE](https://iloveevidence.com) by the Epistemonikos Foundation, just to mention a few ([Chandran 2020][Chandran2020147154]).

In spite of that, I never found a resource that would have the following features at the same time (but if you did, I invite you to publicly discuss it on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/drzhelnov)):

* Exhaustive research coverage
* Focus on secondary research only
* Rigorous _conduct_ appraisals with replication attempts
* Independence proven by full process transparency
* Full Open Access
* Easy to use and friendly to general audiences

Therefore, I embarked on creating such a resource.

_History of the project:_ On [July 11, 2019](https://github.com/p1m-ortho/qs-global-ortho-search-queries/commit/70d3bebf1ed70845950aece09122b49f58fe2880), I inititated a study with the aim of creating an exhaustive registry of systematic reviews in orthopedics (in Russian). Due to the large volume of records to screen, it was not very successful; however, it still did continue up until [Feb 17, 2020](https://github.com/p1m-ortho/qs-global-ortho-search-queries/commit/d44e7db892a23adb8ca3eeb36cbe55b8e05b7b45), when it went into a 200-day hiatus. Since [September 6, 2020](https://github.com/p1m-ortho/qs-global-ortho-search-queries/commit/ff1f29c87483b355b9541859d4b4c39052046936), the study has continued as [![Woodpecker by Anton from The Noun Project](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/drzhelnov/zheln.github.io/gh-pages/favicons/favicon-16x16.png)](https://zheln.com) [Zheln.com](https://zheln.com), a crowdfunding project.

## 4 Objectives: Provide an explicit statement of the objective(s) or question(s) the review addresses

PRISMA 2020 requires use of PICO or PerSPEcTiF ([Booth 2019][Booth2019e001107]) frameworks in this section. However, I could not find these relevant to this review. Therefore, I am using custom formulations:

1. Identify and monitor most of published systematic reviews.
2. Tag the identified systematic records with medical specialties.
3. Select or crowdfund reviews for further appraisal.
4. Critically appraise and replicate the selected systematic reviews.
5. Disseminate practice implications of positively appraised reviews to both the public and evidence-based practitioners.
 
Evidence-based practitioners involve healthcare practitioners, in the first place, but also practitioners in other fields associated with intervention into a human life, such as education, business, policy, or ecology.

# METHODS

## 5 Eligibility criteria: Specify the inclusion and exclusion criteria for the review and how studies were grouped for the syntheses



## 6 Information sources: Specify all databases, registers, websites, organisations, reference lists and other sources searched or consulted to identify studies. Specify the date when each source was last searched or consulted



## 7 Search strategy: Present the full search strategies for all databases, registers and websites, including any filters and limits used



## 8 Selection process: Specify the methods used to decide whether a study met the inclusion criteria of the review, including how many reviewers screened each record and each report retrieved, whether they worked independently, and if applicable, details of automation tools used in the process



## 9 Data collection process: Specify the methods used to collect data from reports, including how many reviewers collected data from each report, whether they worked independently, any processes for obtaining or confirming data from study investigators, and if applicable, details of automation tools used in the process



## 10a Data items: List and define all outcomes for which data were sought. Specify whether all results that were compatible with each outcome domain in each study were sought(e.g. for all measures, time points, analyses), and if not, the methods used to decide which results to collect



## 10b Data items: List and define all other variables for which data were sought (e.g. participant and intervention characteristics, funding sources). Describe any assumptions made about any missing or unclear information



## 11 Study risk of bias assessment: Specify the methods used to assess risk of bias in the included studies, including details of the tool(s) used, how many reviewers assessed each study and whether they worked independently, and if applicable, details of automation tools used in the process



## 12 Effect measures: Specify for each outcome the effect measure(s) (e.g. risk ratio, mean difference) used in the synthesis or presentation of results



## 13a Synthesis methods: Describe the processes used to decide which studies were eligible for each synthesis
