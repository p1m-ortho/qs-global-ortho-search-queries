> Please accept my apologies. However, please also keep in mind this project is independent research and is supported by crowdfunding only. Anyway, I could not possibly appraise **hundreds** of reviews coming up daily on PubMed.

> If you really need me to appraise this review ASAP, please consider [buying a $1 to $10 Zheln subscription](https://patreon.com/zheln) on Patreon. Afterwards, you’ll be able to immediately PM me with the review request. Otherwise, you might as well [send me a donation via PayPal](https://paypal.me/pjelnov) with this reference in the message, and I’ll happily appraise it for you.

> Sure thing, the decision to support Zheln is entirely yours to make. You can always reach out to me directly by [email](mailto:pavel@zheln.com) or on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/drzhelnov), [Facebook](https://facebook.com/drzhelnov), [Instagram](https://instagram.com/igzheln), or [Telegram](https://t.me/drzhelnov), and I’ll do my best to help you regardless of your donations.
