> This abstract checklist retains the same items as those included in the PRISMA for Abstracts statement published in 2013 (_Beller EM, Glasziou PP, Altman DG, Hopewell S, Bastian H, Chalmers I, et al. PRISMA for Abstracts: Reporting Systematic Reviews in Journal and Conference Abstracts. PLoS medicine. 2013;10:e1001419._), but has been revised to make the wording consistent with the PRISMA 2020 statement and includes a new item recommending authors specify the methods used to present and synthesize results (item #6).
