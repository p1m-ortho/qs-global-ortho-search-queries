## Executuve Summary

## Background

I first learned about this review [from Twitter](https://twitter.com/CochraneHTN/status/1339647732135256064). Then I posted about it on my health-educational resources in Russian ([Telegram](https://t.me/sanktprosvet/225), [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/p/CI68VeWA10G/), [VK](https://vk.com/wall-50151591_329)). Also, I asked the subscribers if they wanted an extensive appraisal. As of Dec 19 @ 5am EST, there were seven votes for and two votes against the extensive appraisal.

## Full Text & Other Reports Collected by Zheln

Successfully collected all three versions of this publication: the current 2020 paper, the outdated 2009 paper, and the 2003 protocol.

## Generates Pragmatic Evidence Directly Relevant to Evidence-Based Practice?

All-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality (CV), and rates of myocardial infarction (MI) and stroke are of interest. Most of them (save CV mortality) are featured in the review, so yes, it does in theory generate pragmatic practice-relevant evidence.

## Is Duplicate?

[Google: systematic review target blood pressure](https://www.google.com/search?q=systematic+review+target+blood+pressure).

Some of the top results:

* [Sakima 2019][Sakima2019483495] – full text collected. Not referenced by Arguedas et al., although the research question of Sakima et al. is identical to that of Arguedas et al.
* [Reboussin2018e116e135][Reboussin2018e116e135] (with [a correction][Hypertension2018e145]) – one of the review questions is exactly the same as in the review by Arguedas et al. However, this review is not referenced by the authors of the index review.

These two are important reviews targeting practically the same population, interventions, and outcomes; therefore, there is evidence this review is at least partly duplicate, so, in accordance with the Zheln protocol, will abstain from appraising it further.
