<!-- This is where the fun begins -->
Preterm birth rate, low birth weight rate, and infant mortality are usually listed as adverse birth outcomes. These are clearly patient-important too. The review features some of these, so it does in theory generate practice-important evidence.

I ran a low-effort [Google search: green urban preterm birth meta analysis OR metaanalysis](https://google.com/search?q=green+urban+preterm+birth+meta+analysis+OR+metaanalysis). Some very similar reviews (and recent too) instantly showed ([Akaraci 2020][Akaraci20202949]; [Lee 2020][Lee202091]). I successfully collected all the full texts. The authors do reference [Akaraci 2020][Akaraci20202949] at multiple places throughout the report despite it being a very recent study (April 2020); this is commendable. However, they do not reference [Lee 2020][Lee202091], but this is an even more recent study (August 2020). Also, no registration info is available from [Lee 2020][Lee202091], nor does it show up in the [PROSPERO advanced search](https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/#searchadvanced) results. Three records were found there for `birth AND (green*):TI`:

* Green spaces and birth outcomes: A systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies [[CRD42020177721](https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/display_record.php?ID=CRD42020177721)] – it’s the registration by Hu et al. themselves
* Influence of Residential Greenness on Adverse Pregnancy Outcomes: A Systematic Review and Dose-response Meta-analysis [[CRD42020162387](https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/display_record.php?ID=CRD42020162387)] — I located and collected the report full text ([Zhan 2020][Zhan2020137420]); this study is also notably referenced by Hu et al. despite it being very recent (May 2020)
* The health benefits of the great outdoors: a systematic review and meta-analysis of greenspace exposure and health outcomes [[CRD42015025193](https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/display_record.php?ID=CRD42015025193)] — I located and collected the report full text ([Twohig-Bennett 2018][TwohigBennett2018628637]); this study is not referenced by Hu et al.

From the aforementioned Google search, I also identified closely related reviews by [Porpora et al. (2019)][Porpora201911] and [Bekkar et al. (2020)][Bekkar2020e208243] (with [a correction][JAMANetwOpen2020e208243]; all full texts collected by Zheln). These are also not referenced by Hu et al. Notably, **Bekkar 2020** is [another ongoing appraisal on Zheln](https://zheln.com/record/2020/11/20/429/), so have a look at it too.

At last, [Dzhambov 2014][Dzhambov2014621629] was cited in some of the reports. It was probably the first systematic review on this topic. I have collected its full text too.

The general design layout of these reviews is taking satellite measurements of residential environmental greenness (usually in the form of [NDVI](https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/features/MeasuringVegetation/measuring_vegetation_2.php)), on the one hand, and either birth weight or some bad-pregnancy-outcome rate, on the other hand, and calculating associations between the two variables using meta-analysis.
