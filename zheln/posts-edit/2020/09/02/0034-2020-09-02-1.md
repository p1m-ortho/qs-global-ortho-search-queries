<!-- This is where the fun begins -->
So this is a realist synthesis, not an interventional review; but as authors claim, they have already conducted an [interventional review][Maula2020623635] as a separate undertaking. Why, let‚Äôs have a look at that one first to figure the background. However, there, several other reviews are cited, so we‚Äôll have to look at these first. But within these, some other reviews, too, are referenced. Thus, to keep things nice & clear, let‚Äôs build up a chronology.
