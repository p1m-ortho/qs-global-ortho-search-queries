* Made by reviewing the list of `"j bone joint surg*"[ta]` records on PubMed `Display options Format Abstract` while NOT-ing terms as they came to mind.
* Reduced the [hand-made list of 395 orthopedic references](https://github.com/p1m-ortho/qs-global-ortho-search-queries/blob/global-sr-query/legacy/systematic_live%20-%20ors.csv) (now 384 actual records retrievable for these PMIDs, dunno why) by 54 references (14%), all with relevance to orthopedics but still surgical/medical in general (great sensitivity).
* Reduced the number of Zheln records for Sep 2, 2020, (original count, 409; current count, 407) and Oct 21, 2020, (original count, 1,658; current count, 1,590) by 90 and 446 records (22% and 28%) respectively.
* All searches mentioned above were run in the last few hours (see date/time of commit).
