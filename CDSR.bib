abstract = {Abstract - Background A perianal abscess is a collection of pus under the skin, around the anus. It usually occurs due to an infection of an anal gland. In the UK, the annual incidence is 40 per 100,000 of the adult population, and the standard treatment is admission to hospital for incision and drainage under general anaesthetic. Following drainage of the pus, an internal dressing (pack) is placed into the cavity to stop bleeding. Common practice is for community nursing teams to change the pack regularly until the cavity heals. Some practitioners in the USA and Australia make a small stab incision under local anaesthetic and place a catheter into the cavity which drains into an external dressing. It is removed when it stops draining. Elsewhere in the USA, simple drainage is performed in an outpatient setting under local anaesthetic. Objectives To assess the effects of internal dressings in healing wound cavities resulting from drainage of perianal abscesses. Search methods In May 2016 we searched: The Cochrane Wounds Specialised Register; The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library); Ovid MEDLINE; Ovid MEDLINE (In‐Process & Other Non‐Indexed Citations); Ovid EMBASE and EBSCO CINAHL Plus. We also searched clinical trial registries to identify ongoing and unpublished studies, and searched reference lists of relevant reports to identify additional studies. We did not restrict studies with respect to language, date of publication, or study setting. Selection criteria Published or unpublished randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing any type of internal dressing (packing) used in the post‐operative management of perianal abscess cavities with alternative treatments or different types of internal dressing. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently performed study selection, risk of bias assessment, and data extraction. Main results We included two studies, with a total of 64 randomised participants (50 and 14 participants) aged 18 years or over, with a perianal abscess. In both studies, participants were enrolled on the first post‐operative day and randomised to continued packing by community district nursing teams or to no packing. Participants in the non‐packing group managed their own wounds in the community and used absorbant dressings to cover the area. Fortnightly follow‐up was undertaken until the cavity closed and the skin re‐epithelialised, which constituted healing. For non‐attenders, telephone follow‐up was conducted. Both studies were at high risk of bias due to risk of attrition, performance and detection bias. It was not possible to pool the two studies for the outcome of time to healing. It is unclear whether continued post‐operative packing of the cavity of perianal abscesses affects time to complete healing. One study reported a mean time to wound healing of 26.8 days (95% confidence interval (CI) 22.7 to 30.7) in the packing group and 19.5 days (95% CI 13.6 to 25.4) in the non‐packing group (it was not clear if all participants healed). We re‐analysed the data and found no clear difference in the time to healing (7.30 days longer in the packing group, 95% CI ‐2.24 to 16.84; 14 participants). This was assessed as very low quality evidence (downgraded three levels for very serious imprecision and serious risk of bias). The second study reported a median time to complete wound healing of 24.5 days (range 10 to 150 days) in the packing group and 21 days (range 8 to 90 days) in the non‐packed group. There was insufficient information to be able to recreate the analysis and the original analysis was inappropriate (did not account for censoring). This second study also provided very low quality evidence (downgraded four levels for serious risk of bias, serious indirectness and very serious imprecision). There was very low quality evidence (downgraded for risk of bias, indirectness and imprecision) of no difference in wound pain scores at the initial dressing change. Both studies also reported patients' retrospective judgement of wound pain over the preceding two weeks (visual analogue scale, VAS) as lower for the non‐packed group (2; both studies) compared with the packed group (0; both studies); (very low quality evidence) but we have been unable to reproduce these analyses as no variance data were published. There was no clear evidence of a difference in the number of post‐operative fistulae detected between the packed and non‐packed groups (risk ratio (RR) 2.31, 95% CIs 0.56 to 9.45, I 2  = 0%) (very low quality evidence downgraded three levels for very serious imprecision and serious risk of bias). There was no clear evidence of a difference in the number of abscess recurrences between the packed and non‐packed groups over the variable follow‐up periods (RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.22 to 2.37, I 2  = 0%) (very low quality evidence downgraded three levels for serious risk of bias and very serious imprecision). No study reported participant health‐related quality of life/health status, incontinence rates, time to return to work or normal function, resource use in terms of number of dressing changes or visits to a nurse, or change in wound size. Authors' conclusions It is unclear whether using internal dressings (packing) for the healing of perianal abscess cavities influences time to healing, wound pain, development of fistulae, abscess recurrence or other outcomes. Despite this absence of evidence, the practice of packing abscess cavities is commonplace. Given the lack of high quality evidence, decisions to pack may be based on local practices or patient preferences. Further clinical research is needed to assess the effects and patient experience of packing. Plain language summary Internal dressings for healing perianal abscess cavities What are perianal abscesses and how are they treated? A perianal abscess is a collection of pus under the skin around the anus (back passage); perianal abscesses are common, and usually due to an infection in an anal gland. In the UK, the standard treatment is to have an operation under anaesthetic to cut the skin and drain the pus. This prevents the infection spreading and relieves pain in the affected area. An internal dressing (otherwise known as a "pack") is placed inside the abscess cavity, initially to stop bleeding. The pack is changed by nurses in the community regularly until the cavity has healed. It is thought that packing the cavity reduces the chance of the abscess recurring. Some patients go on to develop a fistula after a perianal abscess. A fistula is an abnormal communication between the anus and the skin next to it and a small hole next to the anus discharges pus intermittently. Fistulae can take many months and several operations to heal. This review aims to assess the effects of packs on healing perianal abscess cavities, particularly the time it took for the cavities to heal, and the amount of pain patients experienced. What we found After extensive searching to find relevant studies, we found only two randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that were eligible for this review (RCTs provide more robust results than other trial types). The studies were small with a total of 64 participants randomised, all over 18 years of age, with a perianal abscess. In the studies, participants received either packing by community nursing teams or no packing. Participants in the non‐packing group managed their own wounds by using absorbant dressings to cover the area with no internal dressing. Participants were seen fortnightly until the cavity had healed. It is not clear whether time to complete wound healing is affected by packing of cavity (and what evidence exists is very low quality). There was very low quality evidence that packing made no difference to wound pain at the first dressing change. There was very low quality evidence that on judging the wound pain over the preceding two weeks, participants in the packing group had experienced more pain that those in the non‐packing group. It is not clear whether packing or not affects the number of post‐operative fistulae or abscess recurrences. We did not find any RCTs that compared participant health‐related quality of life/health status, incontinence rates, time to return to work or normal function, resource use in terms of number of dressing changes or visits to a nurse, or change in wound size. There is no high quality evidence for the use of packing for healing perianal abscess cavities. Assessed as up to date to 17th May 2016.},

abstract = {Abstract - Background The benefits of breastfeeding are well known, and the World Health Organization recommends exclusive breastfeeding for the first six months of life and continuing breastfeeding to age two. However, many women stop breastfeeding due to lactational breast abscesses. A breast abscess is a localised accumulation of infected fluid in breast tissue. Abscesses are commonly treated with antibiotics, incision and drainage (I&D) or ultrasound‐guided needle aspiration, but there is no consensus on the optimal treatment. Objectives To assess the effects of different treatments for the management of breast abscesses in breastfeeding women. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group’s Trial Register (27 February 2015). In addition we searched African Journals Online (27 February 2015), Google Scholar (27 February 2015),  ProQuest Dissertations and Theses Databases  (27 February 2015 )  and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) search portal (27 February 2015). We also checked reference lists of retrieved studies and contacted experts in the field as well as relevant pharmaceutical companies. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) investigating any intervention for treating lactational breast abscesses compared with any other intervention. Studies published in abstract form, quasi‐RCTs and cluster‐RCTs were not eligible for inclusion. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently assessed studies for inclusion, assessed risk of bias and extracted data. Data were checked for accuracy. Main results We included six studies. Overall, trials had an unclear risk of bias for most domains due to poor reporting. Two studies did not stratify data for lactational and non‐lactational breast abscesses, and these studies do not contribute to the results. This review is based on data from four studies involving 325 women. Needle aspiration (with and without ultrasound guidance) versus incision and drainage (I&D) Mean time (days) to complete resolution of breast abscess  (three studies) ‐ there was substantial heterogeneity among these data (Tau 2  = 47.63, I 2  = 97%) and a clear difference between subgroups (with or without ultrasound guidance; Chi 2  = 56.88, I 2  = 98.2%, P = < 0.00001). We did not pool these data in a meta‐analysis. Two studies excluded women who had treatment failure when they calculated the mean time to complete resolution. One study found that the time to complete resolution of breast abscess favoured needle aspiration over I&D (mean difference (MD) ‐6.07; 95% confidence interval (CI) ‐7.81 to ‐4.33; n = 36), but excluded 9/22 (41%) women in the needle aspiration group due to treatment failure. Another study reported faster resolution in the needle aspiration group (MD ‐17.80; 95% CI ‐21.27 to ‐14.33; n = 64) but excluded 6/35 (17%) women in the needle aspiration group due to treatment failure. A third study also reported that needle aspiration was associated with a shorter time to complete resolution of breast abscess (MD ‐16.00; 95%CI ‐18.73 to ‐13.27; n = 60); however, the authors did not indicate the number of women who were lost to follow‐up for either group, and it is unclear how many women contributed to this result. Considering the limitations of the available data, we do not consider the results to be informative. Continuation of breastfeeding, after treatment (success):  results favoured the needle aspiration group, but we did not pool data from the two studies because of substantial unexplained heterogeneity (I 2  = 97%). One study reported that women in the needle aspiration group were more likely to continue breastfeeding (risk ratio (RR) 2.89; 95% CI 1.64 to 5.08; n = 60), whereas the other study found no clear difference (RR 1.09; 95% CI 0.97 to 1.22 n = 70). Treatment failure  was more common among women treated with needle aspiration compared to those who underwent I&D (RR 16.12; 95% CI 2.21 to 117.73; two studies, n = 115,  low quality evidence ). In one study, treatment with needle aspiration failed in 9/22 women who subsequently underwent I&D to treat their breast abscess. In another study, treatment with needle aspiration failed in 6/35 women, who subsequently underwent I&D. All abscesses in the I&D group were successfully treated. The included studies provided limited data for the review's secondary outcomes. No data were reported for  adverse events . One study (60 women) reported that women in the needle aspiration group were more  satisfied with their treatment  than women who received I&D to treat their breast abscesses. Incision and drainage  ( I&D) with or without antibiotics One study (150 women) compared the value of adding a broad‐spectrum cephalosporin (single dose or a course of treatment) to women who underwent I&D for breast abscesses. The mean  time to resolution of breast abscess  was reported as being similar in all groups (although women with infection were excluded). Mean time to resolution for women who received a course of antibiotics was reported as 7.3 days, 6.9 days for women who received a single dose of antibiotics and 7.4 days for women who did not receive antibiotics. Standard deviations, P values and CIs were not reported and prevented further analysis. No data were reported for  any continuation of breastfeeding after treatment (success) . For  treatment failure,  there was no clear difference between the groups of women who received antibiotics (either a single dose or a course of antibiotics) and those who did not (RR 1.00; 95% CI 0.36 to 2.76). Included studies rarely reported this review's secondary outcomes (including adverse events). For  post‐operative complications/morbidity , there was no difference in the risk of wound infections between the antibiotics and no antibiotics groups (RR 0.58; 95% CI 0.29 to 1.17), irrespective of whether women received a single dose or a course of antibiotics. Authors' conclusions There is insufficient evidence to determine whether needle aspiration is a more effective option to I&D for lactational breast abscesses, or whether an antibiotic should be routinely added to women undergoing I&D for lactational breast abscesses. We graded the evidence for the primary outcome of treatment failure as  low quality , with downgrading based on including small studies with few events and unclear risk of bias. Plain language summary Treatments for breast abscesses in breastfeeding women Some women develop a breast abscess while breastfeeding, called a lactational breast abscess. An abscess is a collection of infected fluid within the breast tissue. The aim of treatment is to cure the abscess quickly and effectively, ensuring maximum benefit to the mother with minimal interruption of breastfeeding. Presently, lactational breast abscesses are treated by incision and drainage or needle aspiration, with or without diagnostic ultrasound. Antibiotics may or may not be prescribed. For incision and drainage the abscess is cut open with a scalpel (blade) to release the infected fluid. A drain may be inserted into the wound to help the infected fluid drain or may be left open so that the infected fluid drains naturally. A less invasive way to treat the breast abscess is by needle aspiration. A needle is inserted into the cavity of the breast abscess and a syringe is used to draw out the infected fluid, often using ultrasound guidance. As there are advantages in using this method e.g. no scars, reduced hospitalisation etc. the trend is to use this method more often. We wanted to find evidence on the effectiveness of different treatments. We looked at the time taken for the abscess to heal using the different types of treatments, the number of women who continued to breastfeed after treatment and how many women had healed in the each group after treatment. The definition of healing varied across the studies. We found six studies, of which four studies with a total of 325 woman contributed data. These studies compared needle aspiration versus incision and drainage. Needle aspiration appeared to decrease the healing time compared to incision and drainage, but large proportions of women were excluded from the analysis and it was therefore difficult to make conclusions. For the outcome continuation of breastfeeding, both of the studies showed that women treated with needle aspiration were more likely to continue breastfeeding compared to incision and drainage. In two studies, breast abscesses did not heal in some women who had needle aspiration and had to be treated with incision and drainage (l ow quality evidence ). All breast abscesses that were treated with incision and drainage healed. We were not able to make any conclusions regarding unwanted effects or complications. Studies did not report sufficiently on the number of follow‐up visits, duration of continuation of breastfeeding, post‐operative complications, duration of hospital stay and adverse events. However, it appeared that women were more satisfied when treated with needle aspiration. One study compared different regimens of antibiotics versus no antibiotics in breastfeeding women who were treated with incision and drainage for breast abscesses. We did not find any difference between groups for the outcome resolution of breast abscesses and infections after the procedure. All of the studies were poorly conducted and/or reported and did not address all of the outcomes that we were interested in. Studies with better design and reporting are needed to properly assess these outcomes.},

abstract = {Abstract - Background Appendiceal phlegmon and abscess account for 2% to 10% of acute appendicitis. People with appendiceal phlegmon or abscess usually need an appendicectomy to relieve their symptoms and avoid complications. The timing of appendicectomy for appendiceal phlegmon or abscess is controversial. Objectives To assess the effects of early versus delayed appendicectomy for appendiceal phlegmon or abscess, in terms of overall morbidity and mortality. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Library (CENTRAL; 2016, Issue 7), MEDLINE Ovid (1950 to 23 August 2016), Embase Ovid (1974 to 23 August 2016), Science Citation Index Expanded (1900 to 23 August 2016), and the Chinese Biomedical Literature Database (CBM) (1978 to 23 August 2016). We also searched the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform search portal (23 August 2016) and ClinicalTrials.gov (23 August 2016) for ongoing trials. Selection criteria We included all individual and cluster‐randomised controlled trials, irrespective of language, publication status, or age of participants, comparing early versus delayed appendicectomy in people with appendiceal phlegmon or abscess. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently identified the trials for inclusion, collected the data, and assessed the risk of bias. We performed meta‐analyses using Review Manager 5. We calculated the risk ratio (RR) for dichotomous outcomes and the mean difference (MD) for continuous outcomes with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Main results We included two randomised controlled trials with a total of 80 participants in this review. 1. Early versus delayed open appendicectomy for appendiceal phlegmon Forty participants (paediatric and adults) with appendiceal phlegmon were randomised either to early appendicectomy (appendicectomy as soon as appendiceal mass resolved within the same admission) (n = 20), or to delayed appendicectomy (initial conservative treatment followed by interval appendicectomy six weeks later) (n = 20). The trial was at high risk of bias. There was no mortality in either group. There is insufficient evidence to determine the effect of using either early or delayed open appendicectomy onoverall morbidity (RR 13.00; 95% CI 0.78 to 216.39; very low‐quality evidence), the proportion of participants who developed wound infection (RR 9.00; 95% CI 0.52 to 156.91; very low quality evidence) or faecal fistula (RR 3.00; 95% CI 0.13 to 69.52; very low quality evidence). The quality of evidence for increased length of hospital stay and time away from normal activities in the early appendicectomy group (MD 6.70 days; 95% CI 2.76 to 10.64, and MD 5.00 days; 95% CI 1.52 to 8.48, respectively) is very low quality evidence. The trial reported neither quality of life nor pain outcomes. 2. Early versus delayed laparoscopic appendicectomy for appendiceal abscess Forty paediatric participants with appendiceal abscess were randomised either to early appendicectomy (emergent laparoscopic appendicectomy) (n = 20) or to delayed appendicectomy (initial conservative treatment followed by interval laparoscopic appendicectomy 10 weeks later) (n = 20). The trial was at high risk of bias. The trial did not report on overall morbidity or complications. There was no mortality in either group. We do not have sufficient evidence to determine the effects of using either early or delayed laparoscopic appendicectomy for outcomes relating to hospital stay between the groups (MD −0.20 days; 95% CI −3.54 to 3.14; very low quality of evidence). Health‐related quality of life was measured with the Pediatric Quality of Life Scale‐Version 4.0 questionnaire (a scale of 0 to 100 with higher values indicating a better quality of life). Health‐related quality of life score measured at 12 weeks after appendicectomy was higher in the early appendicectomy group than in the delayed appendicectomy group (MD 12.40 points; 95% CI 9.78 to 15.02) but the quality of evidence was very low. This trial reported neither the pain nor the time away from normal activities. Authors' conclusions It is unclear whether early appendicectomy prevents complications compared to delayed appendicectomy for people with appendiceal phlegmon or abscess. The evidence indicating increased length of hospital stay and time away from normal activities in people with early open appendicectomy is of very low quality. The evidence for better health‐related quality of life following early laparoscopic appendicectomy compared with delayed appendicectomy is based on very low quality evidence. For both comparisons addressed in this review, data are sparse, and we cannot rule out significant benefits or harms of early versus delayed appendicectomy. Further trials on this topic are urgently needed and should specify a set of criteria for use of antibiotics, percutaneous drainage of the appendiceal abscess prior to surgery and resolution of the appendiceal phlegmon or abscess. Future trials should include outcomes such as time away from normal activities, quality of life and the length of hospital stay. Plain language summary Early or delayed surgical removal of appendix in people with symptomatic complicated appendicitis Review question What are the risks and benefits of early versus delayed removal of appendix in people with symptomatic complicated appendicitis? Background The human appendix is a tube at the connection of the small and the large intestines. Possible functions of the appendix may be to protect the body against infection and to maintain healthy levels bacteria in the gut when recovering from diarrhoea. Appendicitis covers a variety of clinical conditions resulting from inflammation of the appendix. Complicated appendicitis is defined as appendiceal phlegmon (simple inflammatory mass without pus located in bottom right of the appendix) or appendiceal abscess (pocket of pus surrounding an acutely inflamed and/or ruptured appendix). People with this condition usually need surgical removal of the appendix to relieve their symptoms and avoid complications. The timing of surgical removal of the appendix is controversial. Immediate surgery is technically demanding. Some experts question the appropriateness of delayed appendectomy, as people are unlikely to experience a recurrence after a successful non‐surgical treatment. However, the true diagnosis could be uncertain in some cases, and postponing the appendectomy may delay diagnosis of underlying disease. Study characteristics We searched for all relevant randomised controlled trials up to 23 August 2016. We identified two trials involving 80 participants. One compared early versus delayed open appendicectomy in 40 children and adults with appendiceal phlegmon. The other trial compared early versus delayed keyhole (laparoscopic) appendicectomy (where surgery is performed through a very small incision) in 40 children with appendiceal abscess. Studies took place in the USA and India. The age of the individuals in the trials varied between 1 year and 84 years, and 27.5% were females. Key results Both two studies were small and had a number of limitations so we cannot be certain about how the effects of the two surgical approaches compare. From one trial in children and adults comparing open with delayed appendicectomy, there was insufficient evidence to show the effect of using either approach on the overall complication rate or the proportion of participants who developed wound infection. Our certainty in a longer stay in hospital stay and time away from normal activities with open appendicectomy is very low. There were no deaths in the study. Quality of life, and pain were not reported in this trial. The other trial in children with appendiceal abscess receiving either early or delayed keyhole appendicectomy did not report on overall complication rates. The trial did not provide enough evidence to show the effect of using either approach on the length of hospital stay among participants. We have very low certainty that children who had early keyhole appendicectomy had better quality of life compared with children who had delayed keyhole appendicectomy. The study did not report if there were any deaths, and did not provide information on pain, or time away from normal activities. At present the benefits and harms of early versus delayed appendicectomy are not well understood because the current information is based upon very low quality evidence. Quality of the evidence Both trials were at a high risk of bias. Overall, we judged the quality of the evidence to be very low. Thus, further well‐designed trials are urgently needed.},

ISSN = {1465-1858},
abstract = {Abstract - Background The perianal abscess is a common surgical problem. A third of perianal abscesses may manifest a fistula‐in‐ano which increases the risk of abscess recurrence requiring repeat surgical drainage. Treating the fistula at the same time as incision and drainage of the abscess may reduce the likelihood of recurrent abscess and the need for repeat surgery. However, this could affect sphincter function in some patients who may not have later developed a fistula‐in‐ano. Objectives We aimed to review the available randomised controlled trial evidence comparing incision and drainage of perianal abscess with or without fistula treatment. Search methods Randomised trials were identified from MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, and reference lists of published papers and reviews. Selection criteria Trials comparing outcome after fistula surgery with drainage of perianal abscess compared with drainage alone were included in the review. Data collection and analysis The primary outcomes were recurrent or persistent abscess/fistula which may require repeat surgery and short‐term and long‐term incontinence. Secondary outcomes were duration of hospitalisation, duration of wound healing, postoperative pain, quality of life scores. For dichotomous variables, relative risks and their confidence intervals were calculated. Main results We identified six trials, involving 479 subjects, comparing incision and drainage of perianal abscess alone versus incision and drainage with fistula treatment. Metaanalysis showed a significant reduction in recurrence, persistent abscess/fistula or repeat surgery in favour of fistula surgery at the time of abscess incision and drainage (RR=0.13, 95% Confidence Interval of RR = 0.07‐0.24). Transient manometric reduction in anal sphincter pressures, without clinical incontinence, may occur after treatment of low fistulae with abscess drainage. Incontinence at one year following drainage with fistula surgery was not statistically significant (pooled RR 3.06, 95% Confidence Interval 0.7‐13.45) with heterogeneity demonstrable between the trials (Chi 2  =5.39,df=3, p=0.14, I 2  =44.4%). Authors' conclusions The published evidence shows fistula surgery with abscess drainage significantly reduces recurrence or persistence of abscess/fistula, or the need for repeat surgery. There was no statistically significant evidence of incontinence following fistula surgery with abscess drainage. This intervention may be recommended in carefully selected patients. Plain language summary Treatment of an anal fistula at the same time as drainage of perianal abscess reduces the chances of recurrent abscess and repeat surgery.   A perianal abscess produces severe pain at or near the back passage (anus) due to an infection with collection of pus (abscess). The treatment is an urgent operation to incise the skin near the anus and drain the pus which relieves the pain. Some patients with a perianal abscess have an associated tunnel called a fistula which connects the anus to the adjacent skin. A fistula can cause problems such as leakage (discharge) from the skin near the anus or may produce a recurrent abscess, and therefore usually requires a repeat operation for its treatment. For this reason it has been proposed that fistula treatment at the same time as drainage of a perianal abscess may be better for patients. This systematic review assesses randomised trials that have addressed the benefits and risks of combined treatment of perianal abscesses and fistulae. Six studies have been published on this topic. The analyses show that combined treatment reduces the risk of persistent abscess or fistula, or repeat surgery without a statistically significant increase in postoperative incontinence.},

Search methods We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (the Cochrane Library, 2017, Issue 6), Ovid MEDLINE (1946 to 30 June 2017), Ovid Embase (1974 to 30 June 2017), Science Citation Index Expanded (1900 to 30 June 2017), World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (30 June 2017), ClinicalTrials.gov (30 June 2017) and Chinese Biomedical Literature Database (CBM) (1978 to 30 June 2017). Selection criteria We included all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared abdominal drainage and no drainage in people undergoing emergency open appendectomy for complicated appendicitis. Data collection and analysis Two review authors identified the trials for inclusion, collected the data, and assessed the risk of bias independently. We performed the meta‐analyses using Review Manager 5. We calculated the risk ratio (RR) for dichotomous outcomes (or a Peto odds ratio for very rare outcomes), and the mean difference (MD) for continuous outcomes with 95% confidence intervals (CI). We used GRADE to rate the quality of evidence. Main results We included six RCTs (521 participants), comparing abdominal drainage and no drainage in patients undergoing emergency open appendectomy for complicated appendicitis. The studies were conducted in North America, Asia and Africa. The majority of the participants had perforated appendicitis with local or general peritonitis. All participants received antibiotic regimens after open appendectomy. None of the trials was at low risk of bias. There was insufficient evidence to determine the effects of abdominal drainage and no drainage on intra‐peritoneal abscess at 14 days (RR 1.23, 95% CI 0.47 to 3.21; 5 RCTs; 453 participants; very low‐quality evidence) or for wound infection at 14 days (RR 2.01, 95% CI 0.88 to 4.56; 5 RCTs; 478 participants; very low‐quality evidence). The increased risk of 30‐day overall complication rate (morbidity) in the drainage group was rated as very low‐quality evidence (RR 6.67, 95% CI 2.13 to 20.87; 1 RCT; 90 participants). There were seven deaths in the drainage group (N = 183) compared to one in the no drainage group (N = 180), equating to an increase in the risk of 30‐day mortality from 0.6% to 2.7% (Peto odds ratio (OR) 4.88, 95% CI 1.18 to 20.09; 4 RCTs; 363 participants; moderate‐quality evidence). There is 'very low‐quality' evidence that drainage increases hospital stay compared to the no drainage group by 2.17 days (95% CI 1.76 to 2.58; 3 RCTs; 298 participants).    Other outlined outcomes, hospital costs, pain, and quality of life, were not reported in any of the included studies. Authors' conclusions The quality of the current evidence is very low. The effect of abdominal drainage on the prevention of intra‐peritoneal abscess or wound infection after open appendectomy is uncertain for patients with complicated appendicitis. The increased rates for overall complication rate and hospital stay for the drainage group compared to no drainage group is also subject to great uncertainty. Thus, there is no evidence for any clinical improvement by using abdominal drainage in patients undergoing open appendectomy for complicated appendicitis. The increased risk of mortality with drainage comes from eight deaths observed in just under 400 people recruited to the studies. Larger studies are needed to determine the effects of drainage on morbidity and mortality outcomes more reliably. Plain language summary Drain use after an open appendectomy for complicated appendicitis We asked Is drainage able to reduce the incidence of intra‐peritoneal abscess (a localised collection of pus in the abdomen or pelvis) after an open appendectomy (removal of the appendix through a large incision in the lower abdomen, known as laparotomy) for complicated appendicitis? Background Appendicitis refers to inflammation of the appendix. Appendectomy, the surgical removal of the appendix, is performed primarily in individuals who have acute appendicitis. Individuals undergoing an appendectomy for complicated appendicitis, which is defined as gangrenous (soft‐tissue death) or perforated (burst) appendicitis, are more likely to suffer from postoperative complications. The routine placement of a surgical drain to prevent intra‐peritoneal abscess after an appendectomy for complicated appendicitis is controversial and has been questioned. Study characteristics We searched for all relevant studies up to 30 June 2017.  We identified six clinical studies involving a total of 521 participants. All six studies compared drain use versus no drain use in individuals having an emergency open appendectomy for complicated appendicitis. Studies were conducted in the USA, India, Kenya, Pakistan, and Turkey. The age of the individuals in the trials ranged from 0 years to 82 years. Key results The analyses were unable to show a difference in the number of individuals with intra‐peritoneal abscess or wound infection when comparing drain use with no drain use. The death rate was higher in the drainage group than in the no drainage group. The hospital stay was longer (about two days ‐ an 43.5% increase on an 'average' stay) in the drain group than in the no drain group. None of the studies reported the costs, pain, and quality of life. Overall, there is no evidence for any clinical improvement by using abdominal drainage in individuals undergoing open appendectomy for complicated appendicitis. Quality of the evidence All of the included studies had shortcomings in terms of methodological quality or reporting of outcomes. Overall, the quality of the current evidence is judged to be very low.},

abstract = {Abstract - Background Metronidazole is the standard of care for uncomplicated amoebic liver abscesses (considering that complicated liver abscesses are those localized in left lobe, multiple, and/or pyogenic abscesses). However, a subset of patients with amoebic liver abscesses remain symptomatic, with a significant risk of rupture of the abscess into the peritoneum. The role of image‐guided percutaneous therapeutic aspiration in these patients remains controversial. Objectives To assess the beneficial and harmful effects of image‐guided percutaneous procedure plus metronidazole versus metronidazole alone in patients with uncomplicated amoebic liver abscess. Search methods We searched the  Cochrane Hepato‐Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register , the  Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials  in  The Cochrane Library  (Issue 2, 2007),  MEDLINE  (1966 to November 2007),  EMBASE  (1988 to September 2007), and  Science Citation Index Expanded  (1945 to September 2007). Selection criteria Randomised or quasi‐randomised trials comparing an image‐guided percutaneous procedure plus metronidazole versus metronidazole alone in patients with uncomplicated amoebic liver abscess. Data collection and analysis Inclusion criteria, trial quality assessment, and data extraction were done in duplicate. We calculated relative risks (RR) and mean differences, and checked for heterogeneity by visual inspection of forest plots and chi‐squared and I 2  tests. Main results Seven low quality randomised trials were included. All studies included a total of 310 patients, but due to selective outcome reporting bias, less patients could be included in our analyses. Pooled analysis of three homogenous trials showed that needle aspiration did not significantly increase the proportion of patients with fever resolution (RR 0.60, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.22 to 1.61). Sensitivity analysis according to trial quality preserved these findings. Trials that evaluated resolution of abdominal pain, days to resolution of fever, pain, resolution of abscess cavities, reduction in liver size, and duration of hospitalisation were heterogeneous. The benefits in the number of days to resolution of pain (MD ‐1.59, 95%CI ‐2.73 to ‐0.42), number of days to resolution of abdominal tenderness (MD ‐1.70, 95%CI ‐2.86 to ‐0.54), and duration of hospitalisation (MD ‐1.31, 95%CI ‐2.05 to ‐0.57) were observed in the needle aspiration group only. Authors' conclusions Therapeutic aspiration in addition to metronidazole to hasten clinical or radiologic resolution of uncomplicated amoebic liver abscesses cannot be supported or refuted by the present evidence. The trials lack methodological rigour and adequate sample size to conclude on the presence of effectiveness of adjunctive image‐guided aspiration plus metronidazole versus metronidazole alone. Further randomised trials are necessary. Plain language summary Percutaneous needle aspiration does not seem to help patients with uncomplicated amoebic liver abscesses Amoebiasis (disease caused by the protozoan  Entameoba histolytica ) remains an important clinical problem in countries around the world, with 40 to 50 million people affected. Mortality rates are significant, with 40,000 to 110,000 deaths each year. In fact, amoebiasis mortality is second only to malaria as cause of death from protozoan parasites. The most common complication of amoebiasis is the formation of a pus‐filled mass inside the liver (liver abscess). Metronidazole is the drug of choice for treatment of amoebic liver abscesses followed by a luminal agent to eradicate the asymptomatic carrier state. Cure rates are 95% with disappearance of fever, pain, and anorexia within 72 to 96 hours. This review compares the standard treatment with a more invasive alternative, where pus‐filled mass is drained by image‐guided percutaneous procedure (performed through the skin). Seven low quality randomised trials were included. All the seven studies included a total of 310 patients, but due to selective outcome reporting bias, less patients could be included in our analyses. Pooled analysis of three homogenous trials showed that needle aspiration did not significantly increase the proportion of patients with fever resolution. Benefits could be observed in resolution time of pain and tenderness. No additional benefit has been found with percutaneous needle aspiration plus metronidazole  versus  metronidazole alone for uncomplicated amoebic liver abscesses in hastening clinical and radiologic resolution. However, this conclusion is based on trials with methodological flaws and with insufficient sample sizes, and requires further confirmation in larger well‐designed, randomised trials.},

abstract = {Abstract - Background Peritonsillar abscess is a common infection presenting as a collection of pus in the peritonsillar area. The condition is characterised by a severe sore throat, difficulty in swallowing and pain on swallowing, fever and malaise, and trismus. Needle aspiration and incision and drainage are the two main treatment modalities currently used in the treatment of this condition. The effectiveness of one versus the other has not been clearly demonstrated and remains an area of debate. Objectives To assess the effectiveness and risks of needle aspiration versus incision and drainage for the treatment of peritonsillar abscess in older children (eight years of age or older), adolescents and adults. Search methods The Cochrane ENT Information Specialist searched the ENT Trials Register; Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2016, Issue 7); Ovid MEDLINE; Ovid Embase; CINAHL; Web of Science; ClinicalTrials.gov; ICTRP and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the search was 25 August 2016. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials comparing needle aspiration with incision and drainage. Data collection and analysis We used the standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Our primary outcomes were recurrence rate (proportion of patients needing repeat intervention) and adverse effects associated with the intervention. Secondary outcomes were time to resumption of normal diet, complications of the disease process and symptom scores. We used GRADE to assess the quality of evidence for each outcome; this is indicated in  italics . Main results We included 11 studies (674 participants). The risk of bias was high or unclear in all of the included studies. All studies compared needle aspiration to incision and drainage. All but one of the 11 studies reported on the primary outcome of  recurrence . When we pooled data from the 10 studies the recurrence rate was higher in the needle aspiration group compared with incision and drainage: risk ratio (RR) 3.74 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.63 to 8.59; 612 participants). We detected moderate heterogeneity in this analysis (I 2  = 48%). In interpreting the pooled result it is important to note that the evidence for this outcome was of  very low quality . None of the other outcomes ( adverse effects  of the intervention,  time to resumption of normal diet ,  complications of the disease process  and  symptom scores ) were consistently measured across all studies. Only three studies reported on  adverse effects/events associated with the intervention  and only one such event in a single patient was reported (post‐procedure bleeding following incision and drainage: 1/28, 3.6%) ( very low‐quality evidence ). Time to resumption of normal diet  was compared in two studies; neither found an obvious difference between needle aspiration and incision and drainage ( very low‐quality evidence ). Only three studies stated that they would report  complications of the disease process . In these three studies, the only complication reported was admission to hospital for dehydration in two patients who underwent incision and drainage (2/13, 6.7%). Symptom scores  were measured in four studies; three evaluated pain using different scales and one other symptoms. The data could not be pooled in a meta‐analysis. Two studies evaluating procedural pain reported this to be lower in the needle aspiration groups. One study found comparable rates of pain resolution at five days post‐intervention between groups. The quality of the evidence for symptom scores was  very low . Authors' conclusions Although a number of studies have sought to evaluate whether or not needle aspiration or incision and drainage is more effective in patients with peritonsillar abscess, there is no high‐quality evidence to allow a firm conclusion to be drawn and the answer remains uncertain.  Very low‐quality evidence  suggests that incision and drainage  may  be associated with a lower chance of recurrence than needle aspiration. There is some  very low‐quality evidence  to suggest that needle aspiration is less painful. Plain language summary Needle aspiration compared to incision and drainage for the treatment of peritonsillar abscess (quinsy) Review question This review compared the effectiveness of the two main treatment options for peritonsillar abscess: needle aspiration and incision and drainage. Background Peritonsillar abscesses are infections at the back of the throat in which a collection of pus (abscess) has formed next to the tonsil. The condition is characterised by a severe sore throat, difficulty in swallowing and pain on swallowing, fever and malaise, and trismus (inability to open the mouth completely). Treatment is usually by one of two methods. The first is needle aspiration (sucking the pus out using a syringe and needle) and the second 'incision and drainage' (putting a small knife into the abscess to let the pus drain out). It remains unclear whether one type of treatment is better than the other. Study characteristics We included 11 studies with a total of 674 participants. The participants in the studies were aged from 8 to 79. The studies were conducted in a number of countries (six from Pakistan, two from the USA, one from Taiwan and two from South Africa). All but one of the 11 studies reported the difference in recurrence rate between needle aspiration and incision and drainage. Four studies compared symptom scores associated with the procedure and two studies compared time to resumption of normal diet. Three studies reported adverse effects/events associated with the intervention. Two studies reported complications of the disease process itself. The evidence is current to August 2016. Key results Ten studies reported on the recurrence of peritonsillar abscess (our main outcome). Most of them did not clearly define 'recurrence' and they varied in the timing of its assessment, however we were able to combine (pool) the data from these studies. When we pooled the data the recurrence rate was higher in the needle aspiration group compared with incision and drainage. It is important to note that the evidence for this outcome was of  very low quality . Some studies found that patients had more pain when they had incision and drainage. Quality of the evidence We identified problems or potential problems in all of the included studies. The most important of these was that the studies did not all assess recurrence in the same way, at the same time, using the same criteria. The quality of the evidence for all of the outcomes that we looked at was  very low .},

abstract = {Abstract - Background Dental pain can have a detrimental effect on quality of life. Symptomatic apical periodontitis and acute apical abscess are common causes of dental pain and arise from an inflamed or necrotic dental pulp, or infection of the pulpless root canal system. Clinical guidelines recommend that the first‐line treatment for teeth with these conditions should be removal of the source of inflammation or infection by local, operative measures, and that systemic antibiotics are currently only recommended for situations where there is evidence of spreading infection (cellulitis, lymph node involvement, diffuse swelling) or systemic involvement (fever, malaise). Despite this, there is evidence that dentists frequently prescribe antibiotics in the absence of these signs. There is concern that this could contribute to the development of antibiotic‐resistant bacterial colonies within both the individual and the community. This review is an update of the original version that was published in 2014. Objectives To evaluate the effects of systemic antibiotics provided with or without surgical intervention (such as extraction, incision and drainage of a swelling, or endodontic treatment), with or without analgesics, for symptomatic apical periodontitis and acute apical abscess in adults. Search methods Cochrane Oral Health's Information Specialist searched the following databases: Cochrane Oral Health's Trials Register (to 26 February 2018), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2018, Issue 1) in the Cochrane Library (searched 26 February 2018), MEDLINE Ovid (1946 to 26 February 2018), Embase Ovid (1980 to 26 February 2018), and CINAHL EBSCO (1937 to 26 February 2018). The US National Institutes of Health Ongoing Trials Register (ClinicalTrials.gov) and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform were searched for ongoing trials. A grey literature search was conducted using OpenGrey (to 26 February 2018) and ZETOC Conference Proceedings (1993 to 26 February 2018). No restrictions were placed on the language or date of publication when searching the electronic databases. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials of systemic antibiotics in adults with a clinical diagnosis of symptomatic apical periodontitis or acute apical abscess, with or without surgical intervention (considered in this situation to be extraction, incision and drainage or endodontic treatment) and with or without analgesics. Data collection and analysis Two authors screened the results of the searches against inclusion criteria, extracted data and assessed risk of bias independently and in duplicate. We calculated mean differences (MD) (standardised mean difference (SMD) when different scales were reported) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for continuous data. A fixed‐effect model was used in the meta‐analysis as there were fewer than four studies. We contacted study authors to obtain missing information. Main results We included two trials in this review, with 62 participants included in the analyses. Both trials were conducted in university dental schools in the USA and compared the effects of oral penicillin V potassium (penicillin VK) versus a matched placebo when provided in conjunction with a surgical intervention (total or partial pulpectomy) and analgesics to adults with acute apical abscess or symptomatic necrotic tooth. The patients included in these trials had no signs of spreading infection or systemic involvement (fever, malaise). We assessed one study as having a high risk of bias and the other study as having unclear risk of bias. The primary outcome variables reported in both studies were participant‐reported pain and swelling (one trial also reported participant‐reported percussion pain). One study reported the type and number of analgesics taken by participants. One study recorded the incidence of postoperative endodontic flare‐ups (people who returned with symptoms that necessitated further treatment). Adverse effects, as reported in one study, were diarrhoea (one participant, placebo group) and fatigue and reduced energy postoperatively (one participant, antibiotic group). Neither study reported quality of life measurements. Objective 1: systemic antibiotics versus placebo with surgical intervention and analgesics for symptomatic apical periodontitis or acute apical abscess   Two studies provided data for the comparison between systemic antibiotics (penicillin VK) and a matched placebo for adults with acute apical abscess or a symptomatic necrotic tooth when provided in conjunction with a surgical intervention. Participants in one study all underwent a total pulpectomy of the affected tooth, while participants in the other study had their tooth treated by either partial or total pulpectomy. Participants in both trials received oral analgesics. There were no statistically significant differences in participant‐reported measures of pain or swelling at any of the time points assessed within the review. The MD for pain (short ordinal numerical scale 0 to 3) was ‐0.03 (95% CI ‐0.53 to 0.47) at 24 hours; 0.32 (95% CI ‐0.22 to 0.86) at 48 hours; and 0.08 (95% CI ‐0.38 to 0.54) at 72 hours. The SMD for swelling was 0.27 (95% CI ‐0.23 to 0.78) at 24 hours; 0.04 (95% CI ‐0.47 to 0.55) at 48 hours; and 0.02 (95% CI ‐0.49 to 0.52) at 72 hours. The body of evidence was assessed as at very low quality. Objective 2: systemic antibiotics without surgical intervention for adults with symptomatic apical periodontitis or acute apical abscess   We found no studies that compared the effects of systemic antibiotics with a matched placebo delivered without a surgical intervention for symptomatic apical periodontitis or acute apical abscess in adults. Authors' conclusions There is very low‐quality evidence that is insufficient to determine the effects of systemic antibiotics on adults with symptomatic apical periodontitis or acute apical abscess. Plain language summary The effects of antibiotics on toothache caused by inflammation or infection at the root of the tooth in adults This Cochrane Review has been produced to assess the effects of antibiotics on the pain and swelling experienced by adults in two conditions commonly responsible for causing dental pain. The review set out to assess the effects of taking antibiotics when provided with, or without, dental treatment. Background Dental pain is a common problem and can arise when the nerve within a tooth dies due to progressing decay or injury. Without treatment, bacteria can infect the dead tooth and cause a dental abscess, which can lead to swelling and spreading infection, which can occasionally be life threatening. The recommended treatment for these forms of toothache is removal of the dead nerve and associated bacteria. This is usually done by extraction of the tooth or root canal treatment (a procedure where the nerve and pulp are removed and the inside of the tooth cleaned and sealed). Antibiotics are only recommended when there is severe infection that has spread from the tooth into the surrounding tissues. However, some dentists still routinely prescribe oral antibiotics to patients with acute dental conditions who have no signs of spreading infection, or without dental treatment to remove the infected material. Use of antibiotics contributes to the development of antibiotic‐resistant bacteria. It is therefore important that antibiotics are only used when they are likely to result in benefit for the patient. Dentists prescribe approximately 8% to 10% of all primary care antibiotics in high‐income countries, and therefore it is important to ensure that dentists have good information about when antibiotics are likely to be beneficial for patients. Study characteristics The evidence on which this review is based was up‐to‐date as of 26 February 2018. We searched scientific databases and found two trials, with 62 participants included in the analysis. Both trials were conducted at dental schools in the USA and evaluated the use of oral antibiotics in the reduction of pain and swelling reported by adults after having the first stage of root canal treatment under local anaesthetic. The antibiotic used in both trials was penicillin VK and all participants also received painkillers. Key results The two studies included in the review reported that there were no clear differences in the pain or swelling reported by participants who received oral antibiotics compared with a placebo (a dummy treatment) when provided alongside the first stage of root canal treatment and painkillers. However, the studies were small and produced poor quality evidence, and therefore we cannot be certain if the results are correct. Neither study examined the effect of antibiotics on their own, without surgical dental treatment. One trial reported side effects among participants: one person who received the placebo medication had diarrhoea and one person who received antibiotics experienced tiredness and reduced energy after their treatment. Quality of evidence We judged the quality of evidence to be very low. There is currently insufficient evidence to be able to determine the effects of antibiotics in these conditions.},

Selection criteria Randomized controlled trials that reported clinically meaningful outcomes and presented results on an intention to treat basis, irrespective of blinding, publication status, or language. Data collection and analysis Data were to be extracted, unblinded, by the two reviewers independently. Main results No studies meeting the inclusion criteria were identified. Authors' conclusions There are no randomized controlled trials about the effectiveness of antibiotic regimens for treating people with cyanotic congenital heart disease who developed a brain abscess. Currently, the antibiotic regimens used are based on previous retrospective studies and clinical experience. There is a need for a well designed multicentre randomized controlled trial to evaluate the effects of different antibiotic regimens. Plain language summary Antibiotics for brain abscesses in people with cyanotic congenital heart disease Serious congenital heart disease leads to abnormal blood flow through the heart and lungs. This results in an inability to carry enough oxygen around the body which makes patients blue (cyanotic) and severely limits their physical activity. People with cyanotic congenital heart disease are at risk of developing brain abscess. This condition is serious and can lead to death because the abscess causes abnormal brain function. Treatment includes antibiotic therapy to kill the bacteria that cause the infection. In people with a large abscess, an operation to drain the abscess may be carried out. Antibiotic therapy for brain abscess should include drugs that penetrate into the abscess cavity. The drugs chosen should also be matched to the sensitivity of the bacteria obtained from the abscess in laboratory culture. There is no evidence from randomized controlled trials to show the best antibiotic regimen for treating people with cyanotic congenital heart disease who develop brain abscess.},

abstract = {Abstract - Background Bacillus Calmette‐Guerín (BCG) is a live attenuated vaccine to prevent tuberculosis, routinely administered at birth as part of the World Health Organization global expanded immunisation programme. Given intradermally, it can cause adverse reactions, including local, regional, distant and disseminated manifestations that may cause parental distress. Rarely, it can cause serious illness and even death. Among those patients with immunocompromised conditions, such as the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, the complication rate is even higher. Objectives To assess the effects of different interventions for treating BCG‐induced disease in children. Search methods The following databases were searched: the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), published in  The Cochrane Library  ( The Cochrane Library  2012, Issue 4); MEDLINE (1966 to November 2012); EMBASE (1947 to November 2012); and LILACS (1980 to November 2012). The metaRegister of Controlled Trials (mRCT) and the WHO trials search portal. Conference proceedings for relevant abstracts and experts were also contacted to identify studies. No language restrictions were applied. Selection criteria Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing any medical or surgical treatment modality for BCG‐induced disease in children. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently evaluated titles, applied inclusion criteria, and assessed the risk of bias of studies. The primary outcomes were the failure rate of therapies for all types of BCG vaccine‐induced complications and the time to resolution of illness measured in months. The secondary outcomes were death from BCG vaccine‐induced disease and the all‐cause mortality. Risk ratios (RRs) were used as measure of effect for dichotomous outcomes and mean differences for continuous outcomes. Main results Five RCTs analysing 341 children addressed the primary outcomes and were included. Four arms compared oral antibiotics to no intervention or placebo, one arm evaluated needle aspiration compared to no intervention, and another evaluated the use of locally instilled isoniazid versus oral erythromycin. Two small studies evaluated oral isoniazid; we are uncertain of whether this intervention has an effect on clinical failure (RR 1.48; 95% Confidence Interval (CI) 0.79 to 2.78; 54 participants, two studies, very low quality evidence). Similarly, for oral erythromycin, we are uncertain if there is an effect (clinical failure RR 1.03; 95% CI 0.70 to 1.53; 148 participants, three studies, very low quality evidence), and for oral isoniazid plus rifampicin (clinical failure, RR 1.20; 95% CI 0.51 to 2.83; 35 participants, one study, very low quality evidence). In patients with lymphadenitis abscess, needle aspiration may reduce clinically persistent BCG‐induced disease at 6 to 9 months of follow‐up (RR 0.13; 95% CI 0.03 to 0.55; 77 participants, one study, low quality evidence). In another study of patients with the same condition, aspiration plus local instillation of isoniazid reduces time to clinical cure compared to aspiration plus oral erythromycin (mean difference 1.49 months less; 95% CI 0.82 to 2.15 less; 27 participants, one study). No RCTs of HIV‐infected infants with a BCG‐induced disease evaluated the use of antibiotics or other therapies for reducing the rate of clinical failure or the time to clinical resolution. No data on mortality secondary to the interventions for treating BCG‐induced disease were reported. Authors' conclusions It is unclear if oral antibiotics (isoniazid, erythromycin, or a combination of isoniazid plus rifampicin) are effective for the resolution of BCG‐induced disease. Most non‐suppurated lymphadenitis will resolve without treatment in 4 to 6 months. Patients with lymphadenitis abscess might benefit from needle aspiration and possibly local instillation of isoniazid could shorten recovery time. Included studies were generally small and could be better conducted. Further research should evaluate the use of needle aspiration and local instillation of isoniazid in fluctuant nodes. Therapeutic and preventive measures in HIV‐infected infants could be important given the higher risk of negative outcomes in this group. Plain language summary Therapies for BCG induced disease in children Bacillus Calmette‐Guérin (BCG) is a widely used tuberculosis vaccine derived from a non‐infectious strain of the bovine tuberculosis bacillus ( Mycobacterium bovis ) and mainly given to young children. Usually, the only adverse reaction to the vaccine is an ulcer at the site of injection, which may leave a small scar. Very occasionally, however, especially in children with weakened immune systems, the vaccine can cause more serious side effects. These can include local infections at the injection site, which may spread to the lymph nodes, causing lymphadenopathy, and the bones, and can even prove life‐threatening. These adverse reactions to the BCG vaccine are a particular risk for children infected with the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), where the condition is known as BCG immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (BCG‐IRIS). In many cases, the infections resolve without any intervention, but treatments can include oral antibiotics, needle aspiration, draining abscesses, and surgically removing infected lymph nodes. This review was conducted to try to determine the effectiveness of these different treatments. The review found no evidence of any benefit of using oral antibiotics to treat local or regional BCG‐induced disease. In patients with abscess‐forming lymphadenopathy, the only intervention with proven benefit was needle aspiration of the abscesses with or without local injection of the antibiotic isoniazid. Based on these findings, the review authors recommend a 'wait and see' approach with follow‐up visits for minor reactions and lymphadenopathy without abscesses. For abscess‐forming lymphadenopathy, which can cause distress and discomfort, they advise needle aspiration. However, this review is based on only five studies, all of which were assessed as having a low or very low quality of evidence. As a consequence, the authors conclude there is an urgent need for more and better studies on ways to prevent and treat BCG‐induced disease, especially BCG‐IRIS.},

abstract = {Abstract - Background Appendicitis is the most common cause of acute abdominal pain requiring surgical intervention. The cause of appendicitis is unclear and the mechanism of pathogenesis continues to be debated. Despite improved asepsis and surgical techniques, postoperative complications, such as wound infection and intraabdominal abscess, still account for a significant morbidity. Several studies implicate that postoperative infections are reduced by administration of antimicrobial regimes. Objectives This review evaluated the use of antibiotics compared to placebo or no treatment in patients undergoing appendectomy. Will these patients benefit from antimicrobial prophylaxis? The outcomes were described according to the nature of the appendix, as either simple appendicitis (including the non‐infectious stage) and complicated appendicitis. The efficacy of different antibiotic regimens were not evaluated. Search methods We searched The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (Cochrane Library 2005 issue 1); Pubmed ; EMBASE; and the Cochrane Colorectal Cancer Group Specialised Register (April 2005). In addition, we manually searched the reference lists of the primary identified trials. Selection criteria We evaluated Randomised Controlled Trials (RCTs) and Controlled Clinical Trials (CCTs) in which any antibiotic regime were compared to placebo in patients suspected of having appendicitis, and undergoing appendectomy. Both studies on children and adults were reviewed. The outcome measures of the studies were: Wound infection, intra abdominal abscess, length of stay in hospital, and mortality. Data collection and analysis Eligibility and trial quality were assessed, recorded and cross‐checked by two reviewers. Main results Forty‐five studies including 9576 patients were included in this review. The overall result is that the use of antibiotics is superior to placebo for preventing wound infection and intraabdominal abscess, with no apparant difference in the nature of the removed appendix. Studies exclusively on children and studies examining topical application reported results in favour to the above, although the results were not significant. Authors' conclusions Antibiotic prophylaxis is effective in the prevention of postoperative complications in appendectomised patients, whether the administration is given pre‐, peri‐ or post‐operatively, and could be considered for routine in emergency appendectomies. Plain language summary Antibiotic prophylaxis could be considered for routine in emergency appendectomies. Appendicitis is the most common cause of acute abdominal pain requiring surgical intervention. This is associated with increased risk of postoperative complications, wound infection being the most commonly reported. Standard prophylaxis is an anti‐bacterial treatment. In order to reduce cost, toxicity and the risk of developing bacterial resistance, it is desirable to establish the shortest and most effective prophylaxis for postoperative complications.   This review reports that antibiotic prophylaxis is effective in the prevention of postoperative complications in people who had the appendix removed. Regardless whether the antibiotic was given before, during or after the surgery.},

abstract = {Abstract - Background Surgical site infections (SSIs) are wound infections that occur after an operative procedure. A preventable complication, they are costly and associated with poorer patient outcomes, increased mortality, morbidity and reoperation rates. Surgical wound irrigation is an intraoperative technique, which may reduce the rate of SSIs through removal of dead or damaged tissue, metabolic waste, and wound exudate. Irrigation can be undertaken prior to wound closure or postoperatively. Intracavity lavage is a similar technique used in operations that expose a bodily cavity; such as procedures on the abdominal cavity and during joint replacement surgery. Objectives To assess the effects of wound irrigation and intracavity lavage on the prevention of surgical site infection (SSI). Search methods In February 2017 we searched the Cochrane Wounds Specialised Register; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); Ovid MEDLINE; Ovid Embase and EBSCO CINAHL Plus. We also searched three clinical trials registries and references of included studies and relevant systematic reviews. There were no restrictions on language, date of publication or study setting. Selection criteria We included all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of participants undergoing surgical procedures in which the use of a particular type of intraoperative washout (irrigation or lavage) was the only systematic difference between groups, and in which wounds underwent primary closure. The primary outcomes were SSI and wound dehiscence. Secondary outcomes were mortality, use of systemic antibiotics, antibiotic resistance, adverse events, re‐intervention, length of hospital stay, and readmissions. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently assessed studies for inclusion at each stage. Two review authors also undertook data extraction, assessment of risk of bias and GRADE assessment. We calculated risk ratios or differences in means with 95% confidence intervals where possible. Main results We included 59 RCTs with 14,738 participants. Studies assessed comparisons between irrigation and no irrigation, between antibacterial and non‐antibacterial irrigation, between different antibiotics, different antiseptics or different non‐antibacterial agents, or between different methods of irrigation delivery. No studies compared antiseptic with antibiotic irrigation. Surgical site infection Irrigation compared with no irrigation (20 studies; 7192 participants): there is no clear difference in risk of SSI between irrigation and no irrigation (RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.11; I 2  = 28%; 14 studies, 6106 participants). This would represent an absolute difference of 13 fewer SSIs per 1000 people treated with irrigation compared with no irrigation; the 95% CI spanned from 31 fewer to 10 more SSIs. This was low‐certainty evidence downgraded for risk of bias and imprecision. Antibacterial irrigation compared with non‐antibacterial irrigation (36 studies, 6163 participants): there may be a lower incidence of SSI in participants treated with antibacterial irrigation compared with non‐antibacterial irrigation (RR 0.57, 95% CI 0.44 to 0.75; I 2  = 53%; 30 studies, 5141 participants). This would represent an absolute difference of 60 fewer SSIs per 1000 people treated with antibacterial irrigation than with non‐antibacterial (95% CI 35 fewer to 78 fewer). This was low‐certainty evidence downgraded for risk of bias and suspected publication bias. Comparison of irrigation of two agents of the same class (10 studies; 2118 participants): there may be a higher incidence of SSI in participants treated with povidone iodine compared with superoxidised water (Dermacyn) (RR 2.80, 95% CI 1.05 to 7.47; low‐certainty evidence from one study, 190 participants). This would represent an absolute difference of 95 more SSIs per 1000 people treated with povidone iodine than with superoxidised water (95% CI 3 more to 341 more). All other comparisons found low‐ or very low‐certainty evidence of no clear difference between groups. Comparison of two irrigation techniques: two studies compared standard (non‐pulsed) methods with pulsatile methods. There may, on average, be fewer SSIs in participants treated with pulsatile methods compared with standard methods (RR 0.34, 95% CI 0.19 to 0.62; I 2  = 0%; two studies, 484 participants). This would represent an absolute difference of 109 fewer SSIs occurring per 1000 with pulsatile irrigation compared with standard (95% CI 62 fewer to 134 fewer). This was low‐certainty evidence downgraded twice for risks of bias across multiple domains. Wound dehiscence Few studies reported wound dehiscence. No comparison had evidence for a difference between intervention groups. This included comparisons between irrigation and no irrigation (one study, low‐certainty evidence); antibacterial and non‐antibacterial irrigation (three studies, very low‐certainty evidence) and pulsatile and standard irrigation (one study, low‐certainty evidence). Secondary outcomes Few studies reported outcomes such as use of systemic antibiotics and antibiotic resistance and they were poorly and incompletely reported. There was limited reporting of mortality; this may have been partially due to failure to specify zero events in participants at low risk of death. Adverse event reporting was variable and often limited to individual event types. The evidence for the impact of interventions on length of hospital stay was low or moderate certainty; where differences were seen they were too small to be clinically important. Authors' conclusions The evidence base for intracavity lavage and wound irrigation is generally of low certainty. Therefore where we identified a possible difference in the incidence of SSI (in comparisons of antibacterial and non‐antibacterial interventions, and pulsatile versus standard methods) these should be considered in the context of uncertainty, particularly given the possibility of publication bias for the comparison of antibacterial and non‐antibacterial interventions. Clinicians should also consider whether the evidence is relevant to the surgical populations under consideration, the varying reporting of other prophylactic antibiotics, and concerns about antibiotic resistance. We did not identify any trials that compared an antibiotic with an antiseptic. This gap in the direct evidence base may merit further investigation, potentially using network meta‐analysis; to inform the direction of new primary research. Any new trial should be adequately powered to detect a difference in SSIs in eligible participants, should use robust research methodology to reduce the risks of bias and internationally recognised criteria for diagnosis of SSI, and should have adequate duration and follow‐up. Plain language summary 'Washout' during surgery for prevention of surgical site infection What is the aim of this review? The aim of this review was to find out whether intracavity lavage and wound irrigation (washing out a wound during surgery) can help to prevent surgical site infection (SSI). Researchers from Cochrane collected and analysed all relevant studies (randomised controlled trials) to answer this question and found 59 relevant studies. Key messages The certainty of all the evidence we gathered on the effect of washing out wounds on SSIs was low or very low. This was due to problems with how results were reported, some small sample sizes and concern that not all relevant evidence was published. This means that the true effects of treatments may be substantially different from our results. Washing out surgical wounds may make no clear difference to SSI rates compared with not washing out. Using antibacterial solutions to wash out wounds may reduce infection rates compared with non‐antibacterial products. Pumping the washing solution into the wound may reduce infections compared with other methods of washing out. Side effects were not well reported. What was studied in the review? Infections can often develop in wounds following surgery. This can prevent the wound from healing and can lead to infection spreading through the body. People with SSIs spend longer in hospital and are more likely to need a repeat operation. Techniques used to reduce the risk of infection include intracavity lavage or wound irrigation (washing out the wound during surgery using water or medicated solutions). We wanted to find out if this reduced SSI rates, and improved wound healing. We also wanted to find out about serious consequences such as severe infections that cannot be treated with antibiotics, abscesses, and lengthy hospital stays. What are the main results of the review? We found 59 studies involving 14,738 participants (both adults and children). Some studies enrolled only women because of the type of surgery (e.g. caesarean sections). The studies compared washing out wounds with no treatment, antibacterial and non‐antibacterial washing solutions, and different methods of washing. Follow‐up times ranged from a few days to several months but most were between two and eight weeks. Most studies did not state how they were funded, but when funding was reported it was mostly non‐commercial. Twenty studies involving 7192 participants compared washing out with no washing. The results showed no clear difference in SSI rates (low‐certainty evidence). Antibacterial washing solutions may reduce infection rates compared with non‐antibacterial solutions (low‐certainty evidence from 36 trials involving 6163 participants). Two studies involving 484 participants compared standard washing methods (pouring using a jug or a syringe) with pumping or pulsing the washing solution. There may be fewer SSIs when the solution is pumped into the wound (low‐certainty evidence). There may be fewer SSIs when a solution of povidone iodine is used compared with an alternative antiseptic (superoxidised water, Dermacyn) (low‐certainty evidence from 1 trial with 190 participants). The results for all other comparisons showed no clear differences or were very uncertain. Wound reopening (dehiscence), infections, which are hard to treat with antibiotics, and deaths were not widely reported. Washing out wounds may not affect the length of time people stay in hospital (low‐ or moderate‐certainty evidence). How up to date is this review? We searched for studies that had been published up to February 2017.},

abstract = {Abstract - Background The removal of the acute appendix is one of the most frequently performed surgical procedures. Open surgery associated with therapeutic efficacy has been the treatment of choice for acute appendicitis. However, in consequence of the evolution of endoscopic surgery, the operation can also be performed with minimally invasive surgery. Due to smaller incisions, the laparoscopic approach may be associated with reduced postoperative pain, reduced wound infection rate, and shorter time until return to normal activity.  This is an update of the review published in 2010. Objectives To compare the effects of laparoscopic appendectomy (LA) and open appendectomy (OA) with regard to benefits and harms. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Ovid MEDLINE and Embase (9 February 2018). We identified proposed and ongoing studies from World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP), ClinicalTrials.gov and EU Clinical Trials Register (9 February 2018). We handsearched reference lists of identified studies and the congress proceedings of endoscopic surgical societies. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing LA versus OA in adults or children. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently selected studies, assessed the risk of bias, and extracted data. We performed the meta‐analyses using Review Manager 5. We calculated the Peto odds ratio (OR) for very rare outcomes, and the mean difference (MD) for continuous outcomes (or standardised mean differences (SMD) if researchers used different scales such as quality of life) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). We used GRADE to rate the quality of the evidence. Main results We identified 85 studies involving 9765 participants. Seventy‐five trials included 8520 adults and 10 trials included 1245 children. Most studies had risk of bias issues, with attrition bias being the largest source across studies due to incomplete outcome data. In adults, pain intensity on day one was reduced by 0.75 cm on a 10 cm VAS after LA (MD ‐0.75, 95% CI ‐1.04 to ‐0.45; 20 RCTs; 2421 participants; low‐quality evidence). Wound infections were less likely after LA (Peto OR 0.42, 95% CI 0.35 to 0.51; 63 RCTs; 7612 participants; moderate‐quality evidence), but the incidence of intra‐abdominal abscesses was increased following LA (Peto OR 1.65, 95% CI 1.12 to 2.43; 53 RCTs; 6677 participants; moderate‐quality evidence).  The length of hospital stay was shortened by one day after LA (MD ‐0.96, 95% CI ‐1.23 to ‐0.70; 46 RCTs; 5127 participant; low‐quality evidence). The time until return to normal activity occurred five days earlier after LA than after OA (MD ‐4.97, 95% CI ‐6.77 to ‐3.16; 17 RCTs; 1653 participants; low‐quality evidence). Two studies showed better quality of life scores following LA, but used different scales, and therefore no pooled estimates were presented. One used the SF‐36 questionnaire two weeks after surgery and the other used the Gastro‐intestinal Quality of Life Index six weeks and six months after surgery (both low‐quality evidence). In children, we found no differences in pain intensity on day one (MD ‐0.80, 95% CI ‐1.65 to 0.05; 1 RCT; 61 participants; low‐quality evidence), intra‐abdominal abscesses after LA (Peto OR 0.54, 95% CI 0.24 to 1.22; 9 RCTs; 1185 participants; low‐quality evidence) or time until return to normal activity (MD ‐0.50, 95% CI ‐1.30 to 0.30; 1 RCT; 383 participants; moderate‐quality evidence). However, wound infections were less likely after LA (Peto OR 0.25, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.42; 10 RCTs; 1245 participants; moderate‐quality evidence) and the length of hospital stay was shortened by 0.8 days after LA (MD ‐0.81, 95% CI ‐1.01 to ‐0.62; 6 RCTs; 316 participants; low‐quality evidence). Quality of life was not reported in any of the included studies. Authors' conclusions Except for a higher rate of intra‐abdominal abscesses after LA in adults, LA showed advantages over OA in pain intensity on day one, wound infections, length of hospital stay and time until return to normal activity in adults. In contrast, LA showed advantages over OA in wound infections and length of hospital stay in children. Two studies reported better quality of life scores in adults. No study reported this outcome in children. However, the quality of evidence ranged from very low to moderate and some of the clinical effects of LA were small and of limited clinical relevance. Future studies with low risk of bias should investigate, in particular, the quality of life in children. Plain language summary Laparoscopic surgery compared to open surgery for suspected appendicitis Review question We reviewed the evidence about the effects of the open operation technique and the minimally invasive procedure in persons with suspected appendicitis. Background In the right lower part of the abdomen there is a small blind ending intestinal tube, called the appendix. Inflammation of the appendix is called appendicitis which is most frequent in children and young adults. Most cases require emergency surgery in order to avoid rupture of the appendix into the abdomen. During the operation, called appendectomy, the inflamed appendix is surgically removed. The traditional surgical approach involves a small incision (about 5 cm or 2 inches) in the right lower abdominal wall. Alternatively, it is possible to remove the inflamed appendix using another surgical technique, known as laparoscopic appendectomy. This operation requires three very small incisions (each about 1 cm or 1/2 inch). Then the surgeon introduces a camera and instruments into the abdomen and removes the appendix. Study characteristics We included 85 studies involving 9765 participants, of which 75 trials compared laparoscopic appendectomy versus open appendectomy in adults. The remaining 10 studies included only children. The evidence is current to February 2018. Key results The main advantages of laparoscopic compared to open appendectomy were reduced postsurgical pain, reduced risk of wound infection, shorter hospital stay, and more rapid return to normal activities in adults. In contrast, laparoscopic appendectomy showed advantages over open appendectomy in wound infections and shorter hospital stay in children. Two studies reported that adults who received laparoscopic appendectomy had better quality of life two weeks, six weeks, and six months after surgery. Data from children were not available. As for disadvantages of laparoscopic appendectomy, a higher rate of intra‐abdominal abscesses were identified in adults but not in children. Except for a trend towards decreased intra‐abdominal abscesses after LA, the results for children were similar to those seen in adults. Quality of the evidence The quality of the evidence varied from moderate to low because of poorly conducted studies.},

abstract = {Abstract - Background Mastitis can be caused by ineffective positioning of the baby at the breast or restricted feeding. Infective mastitis is commonly caused by  Staphylococcus aureus . The prevalence of mastitis in breastfeeding women may reach 33%. Effective milk removal, pain medication and antibiotic therapy have been the mainstays of treatment. Objectives This review aims to examine the effectiveness of antibiotic therapies in relieving symptoms for breastfeeding women with mastitis with or without laboratory investigation. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (30 September 2012), contacted investigators and other content experts known to us for unpublished trials and scanned the reference lists of retrieved articles. Selection criteria We selected randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi‐RCTs comparing the effectiveness of various types of antibiotic therapies or antibiotic therapy versus alternative therapies for the treatment of mastitis. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. When in dispute, we consulted a third author. Main results Two trials met the inclusion criteria. One small trial (n = 25) compared amoxicillin with cephradine and found no significant difference between the two antibiotics in terms of symptom relief and abscess formation. Another, older study compared breast emptying alone as 'supportive therapy' versus antibiotic therapy plus supportive therapy, and no therapy. The findings of the latter study suggested faster clearance of symptoms for women using antibiotics, although the study design was problematic. Authors' conclusions There is insufficient evidence to confirm or refute the effectiveness of antibiotic therapy for the treatment of lactational mastitis. There is an urgent need to conduct high‐quality, double‐blinded RCTs to determine whether antibiotics should be used in this common postpartum condition. Plain language summary Antibiotics for mastitis in breastfeeding women Inflammation of the breast, or mastitis, can be infective or non‐infective. Infective mastitis is one of the most common infections experienced by breastfeeding women. The condition (infective or not) varies in severity, ranging from mild symptoms with some local inflammation, redness, warmth and tenderness in the affected breast through to more serious symptoms including fever, abscess and septicaemia, which may require hospitalisation. Recovery can take time, and there may be substantial discomfort for the affected mother and her baby. Mastitis usually occurs during the first three months after birth and results in the mother being confined to bed for one day, followed by restricted activity. The condition is associated with decreased milk secretion, decreased productivity, and in difficulties caring for the baby. This burden to mothers, along with the cost of care, the potential negative impact on continuation of breastfeeding, and the danger of serious complications such as septicaemia, makes mastitis a serious condition which warrants early diagnosis and effective therapy. The review included two studies and approximately 125 women. One study compared two different antibiotics, and there were no differences between the two antibiotics for symptom relief. A second study comparing no treatment, breast emptying, and antibiotic therapy, with breast emptying suggested more rapid symptom relief with antibiotics. There is very little evidence on the effectiveness of antibiotic therapy, and more research is needed.},

abstract = {Abstract - Background Pulmonary arteriovenous malformations are abnormal direct connections between the pulmonary artery and pulmonary vein which result in a right‐to‐left shunt. They are associated with substantial morbidity and mortality mainly from the effects of paradoxical emboli. Potential complications include stroke, cerebral abscess, pulmonary haemorrhage and hypoxaemia. Embolisation is an endovascular intervention based on the occlusion of the feeding arteries the pulmonary arteriovenous malformations thus eliminating the abnormal right‐to‐left‐shunting. This is an update of a previously published review. Objectives To determine the efficacy and safety of embolisation in patients with pulmonary arteriovenous malformations including a comparison with surgical resection and different embolisation devices. Search methods We searched the Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group's Trials Register; date of last search: 10 April 2017. We also searched the following databases: the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry; ClinicalTrials.gov; International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial Number Register; International Clinical Trials Registry Platform Search Portal (last searched 27 August 2017). to be updated We checked cross‐references and searched references from review articles. Selection criteria Trials in which individuals with pulmonary arteriovenous malformations were randomly allocated to embolisation compared to no treatment, surgical resection or embolisation using a different embolisation device . Data collection and analysis Studies identified for potential inclusion were independently assessed for eligibility by two authors, with excluded studies further checked by a third author. No trials were identified for inclusion in the review and hence no analysis was performed. Main results There were no randomised controlled trials included in the review; one ongoing trial has been identified which may be eligible for inclusion in the future. Authors' conclusions There is no evidence from randomised controlled trials for embolisation of pulmonary arteriovenous malformations. However, randomised controlled trials are not always feasible on ethical grounds. Accumulated data from observational studies suggest that embolisation is a safe procedure which reduces morbidity and mortality. A standardised approach to reporting with long‐term follow‐up through registry studies can help to strengthen the evidence for embolisation in the absence of randomised controlled trials. Plain language summary Embolisation therapy for pulmonary arteriovenous malformations Review question We reviewed the evidence about the effect of blocking the blood vessels which feed abnormal direct connections between arteries and veins in people who have these in their lungs. Background Pulmonary arteriovenous malformations are abnormal connections between arteries and veins in the lung which can cause serious complications such as stroke, brain abscess, bleeding in the lung and poor oxygenation. Embolisation is the mainstream treatment for pulmonary arteriovenous malformations. During the procedure, balloon or coil embolisation devices (or both combined) are used to block the feeding artery or arteries to the malformation. These malformations can often be small, multiple and widely spread out, so not all of them are suitable for embolisation treatment. This is an update of a previously published review. Search date The evidence is current to: 10 April 2017. Study characteristics In this systematic review, we did not include any randomised controlled trials of embolisation versus surgery or comparing different embolisation devices. We have identified one ongoing trial comparing two different embolisation devices which might be eligible for inclusion in the review when it is completed. Key results While no randomised controlled trials of this treatment are included in this review, a number of observational studies have suggested embolisation therapy has benefits. However, randomised controlled trials are not always feasible on ethical grounds. In the absence of randomised controlled trials, a standardised approach to reporting, as well as long‐term follow‐up through registry studies can help to improve the safety and outcome of embolisation for pulmonary arteriovenous malformations. Quality of the evidence We have not been able to present any evidence from randomised controlled trials in this version of the review.},

abstract = {Abstract - Background Several studies have demonstrated that the use of pancreatic duct stents following pancreaticoduodenectomy is associated with a lower risk of pancreatic fistula. However, to date there is a lack of accord in the literature on whether the use of stents is beneficial and, if so, whether internal or external stenting, with or without replacement, is preferable. This is an update of a systematic review. Objectives To determine the efficacy of pancreatic stents in preventing pancreatic fistula after pancreaticoduodenectomy. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science, and four major Chinese biomedical databases up to November 2015. We also searched several major trials registers. Selection criteria Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing the use of stents (either internal or external) versus no stents, and comparing internal stents versus external stents, replacement versus no replacement following pancreaticoduodenectomy. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently extracted the data. The outcomes studied were incidence of pancreatic fistula, need for reoperation, length of hospital stay, overall complications, and in‐hospital mortality. We showed the results as risk ratio (RR) or mean difference (MD), with 95% confidence interval (CI). We assessed the quality of evidence using GRADE ( http://www.gradeworkinggroup.org/ ). Main results We included eight studies (1018 participants). The average age of the participants ranged from 56 to 68 years. Most of the studies were conducted in single centers in Japan (four studies), China (two studies), France (one study), and the USA (one study). The risk of bias was low or unclear for most domains across the studies. Stents versus no stents The effect of stents on reducing pancreatic fistula in people undergoing pancreaticoduodenectomy was uncertain due to the low quality of the evidence (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.39 to 1.14; 605 participants; 4 studies). The risk of in‐hospital mortality was 3% in people who did receive stents compared with 2% (95% CI 1% to 6%) in people who had stents (RR 0.73, 0.28 to 1.94; 605 participants; 4 studies; moderate‐quality evidence). The effect of stents on reoperation was uncertain due to wide confidence intervals (RR 0.67, 0.36 to 1.22; 512 participants; 3 studies; moderate‐quality evidence). We found moderate‐quality evidence that using stents reduces total hospital stay by just under four days (mean difference (MD) ‐3.68, 95% CI ‐6.52 to ‐0.84; 605 participants; 4 studies). The risk of delayed gastric emptying, wound infection, and intra‐abdominal abscess was uncertain (gastric emptying: RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.24 to 2.35; moderate‐quality evidence) (wound infection: RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.40 to 1.32; moderate‐quality evidence) (abscess: RR 1.38, 0.49 to 3.85; low‐quality evidence). Subgroup analysis by type of stent provided limited evidence that external stents lead to lower risk of fistula compared with internal stents. External versus internal stents The effect of external stents on the risk of pancreatic fistula, reoperation, delayed gastric emptying, and intra‐abdominal abscess compared with internal stents was uncertain due to low‐quality evidence (fistula: RR 1.44, 0.94 to 2.21; 362 participants; 3 studies) (reoperation: RR 2.02, 95% CI 0.38 to 10.79; 319 participants; 3 studies) (gastric emptying: RR 1.65, 0.66 to 4.09; 362 participants; 3 studies) (abscess: RR 1.91, 95% CI 0.80 to 4.58; 362 participants; 3 studies). The rate of in‐hospital mortality was lower in studies comparing internal and external stents than in those comparing stents with no stents. One death occurred in the external‐stent group (RR 0.33, 0.01 to 7.99; low‐quality evidence). There were no cases of pancreatitis in participants who had internal stents compared with three in those who had external stents (RR 0.15, 0.01 to 2.73; low‐quality evidence). The difference between internal and external stents on total hospital stay was uncertain due to the wide confidence intervals around the average effect of 1.7 days fewer with internal stents (9.18 days fewer to 5.84 days longer; 262 participants; 2 studies; low‐quality evidence). The analysis of wound infection could not exclude a protective effect with either approach (RR 1.41, 0.44 to 4.48; 319 participants; 2 studies; moderate‐quality evidence). Operative replacement of pancreatic juice versus not replacing pancreatic juice There was insufficient evidence available from a small trial to ascertain the effect of replacing pancreatic juice. Authors' conclusions This systematic review has identified limited evidence on the effects of stents. We have not been able to identify convincing direct evidence of superiority of external over internal stents. We found a limited number of RCTs with small sample sizes. Further RCTs on the use of stents after pancreaticoduodenectomy are warranted. Plain language summary Stents for preventing pancreatic fistula after pancreaticoduodenectomy Review question Are pancreatic stents useful in preventing pancreatic fistula after pancreaticoduodenectomy? Background There is no accord in studies on whether the use of stents is beneficial and, if so, whether the use of internal or external stents, with or without replacement is preferable. Study characteristics The use of stents following pancreaticoduodenectomy was studied in 1018 participants from eight randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Key results We found no evidence that the use of stents leads to lower risk of fistula when compared with no stents. We also found no evidence of a difference between the use of internal and external stents. There was not enough evidence to determine the effects of replacement of pancreatic juice versus no replacement of pancreatic juice. Further RCTs on the use of stents after pancreaticoduodenectomy are needed. Quality of the evidence All eight included studies were reported as RCTs. The quality of the findings ranged from moderate to low across the different outcomes. The main limiting factor, which was the reason for a decrease in quality in some outcomes, was only one study included in internal stents versus no stents group. It is important to acknowledge the large potential impact if the average effect of one study differs in size or direction.},

abstract = {Abstract - Background Pancreatoduodenectomy is a surgical procedure used to treat diseases of the pancreatic head and, less often, the duodenum. The most common disease treated is cancer, but pancreatoduodenectomy is also used for people with traumatic lesions and chronic pancreatitis. Following pancreatoduodenectomy, the pancreatic stump must be connected with the small bowel where pancreatic juice can play its role in food digestion. Pancreatojejunostomy (PJ) and pancreatogastrostomy (PG) are surgical procedures commonly used to reconstruct the pancreatic stump after pancreatoduodenectomy. Both of these procedures have a non‐negligible rate of postoperative complications. Since it is unclear which procedure is better, there are currently no international guidelines on how to reconstruct the pancreatic stump after pancreatoduodenectomy, and the choice is based on the surgeon's personal preference. Objectives To assess the effects of pancreaticogastrostomy compared to pancreaticojejunostomy on postoperative pancreatic fistula in participants undergoing pancreaticoduodenectomy. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2016, Issue 9), Ovid MEDLINE (1946 to 30 September 2016), Ovid Embase (1974 to 30 September 2016) and CINAHL (1982 to 30 September 2016). We also searched clinical trials registers (ClinicalTrials.gov and WHO ICTRP) and screened references of eligible articles and systematic reviews on this subject. There were no language or publication date restrictions. Selection criteria We included all randomized controlled trials (RCTs) assessing the clinical outcomes of PJ compared to PG in people undergoing pancreatoduodenectomy. Data collection and analysis We used standard methodological procedures expected by The Cochrane Collaboration. We performed descriptive analyses of the included RCTs for the primary (rate of postoperative pancreatic fistula and mortality) and secondary outcomes (length of hospital stay, rate of surgical re‐intervention, overall rate of surgical complications, rate of postoperative bleeding, rate of intra‐abdominal abscess, quality of life, cost analysis). We used a random‐effects model for all analyses. We calculated the risk ratio (RR) for dichotomous outcomes, and the mean difference (MD) for continuous outcomes (using PG as the reference) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) as a measure of variability. Main results We included 10 RCTs that enrolled a total of 1629 participants. The characteristics of all studies matched the requirements to compare the two types of surgical reconstruction following pancreatoduodenectomy. All studies reported incidence of postoperative pancreatic fistula (the main complication) and postoperative mortality. Overall, the risk of bias in included studies was high; only one included study was assessed at low risk of bias. There was little or no difference between PJ and PG in overall risk of postoperative pancreatic fistula (PJ 24.3%; PG 21.4%; RR 1.19, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.62; 7 studies; low‐quality evidence). Inclusion of studies that clearly distinguished clinically significant pancreatic fistula resulted in us being uncertain whether PJ improved the risk of pancreatic fistula when compared with PG (19.3% versus 12.8%; RR 1.51, 95% CI 0.92 to 2.47; very low‐quality evidence). PJ probably has little or no difference from PG in risk of postoperative mortality (3.9% versus 4.8%; RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.53 to 1.34; moderate‐quality evidence). We found low‐quality evidence that PJ may differ little from PG in length of hospital stay (MD 1.04 days, 95% CI ‐1.18 to 3.27; 4 studies, N = 502) or risk of surgical re‐intervention (11.6% versus 10.3%; RR 1.18, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.61; 7 studies, N = 1263). We found moderate‐quality evidence suggesting little difference between PJ and PG in terms of risk of any surgical complication (46.5% versus 44.5%; RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.18; 9 studies, N = 1513). PJ may slightly improve the risk of postoperative bleeding (9.3% versus 13.8%; RR 0.69, 95% CI: 0.51 to 0.93; low‐quality evidence; 8 studies, N = 1386), but may slightly worsen the risk of developing intra‐abdominal abscess (14.7% versus 8.0%; RR 1.77, 95% CI 1.11 to 2.81; 7 studies, N = 1121; low quality evidence). Only one study reported quality of life (N = 320); PG may improve some quality of life parameters over PJ (low‐quality evidence). No studies reported cost analysis data. Authors' conclusions There is no reliable evidence to support the use of pancreatojejunostomy over pancreatogastrostomy. Future large international studies may shed new light on this field of investigation. Plain language summary Attachment to the jejunum versus stomach for the reconstruction of pancreatic stump following pancreaticoduodenectomy ('Whipple' operation) Review question Is pancreaticogastrostomy (PG, a surgery to join the pancreas to the stomach) better than pancreaticojejunostomy (PJ, a surgery to join the pancreas to the bowel) in terms of postoperative pancreatic fistula after a 'Whipple' operation (a major surgical operation involving the pancreas, duodenum, and other organs)? Background Pancreatoduodenectomy ('Whipple' operation) is a surgical procedure to treat diseases (most often cancer) of the pancreatic head, and sometimes, the duodenum. In a Whipple operation, the pancreas is detached from the gut then reconnected to enable pancreatic juice containing digestive enzymes to enter the digestive system. A common complication following Whipple surgery is pancreatic fistula, which occurs when the reconnection does not heal properly, leading to pancreatic juice leaking from the pancreas to abdominal tissues. This delays recovery from surgery and often requires further treatment to ensure complete healing. PJ and PG are surgical procedures often used to reconstruct the pancreatic stump after Whipple surgery and both procedures are burdened by a non‐negligible rate of postoperative pancreatic fistula. It is unclear which procedure is better. Search date We searched up to September 2016. Study characteristics We included 10 randomized controlled studies (1629 participants) that compared PJ and PG in people undergoing Whipple surgery. The studies' features were adequate to make feasible and the planned comparison between the two surgical techniques. The primary outcomes were pancreatic fistula and death. Secondary outcomes were duration of hospitalization, surgical re‐intervention, overall complications, bleeding, abdominal abscess, quality of life, and costs. Key results We could not demonstrate that one surgical procedure is better than the other. PJ may have little or no difference from PG in overall postoperative pancreatic fistula rate (PJ 24.3%; PG 21.4%), duration of hospitalization, or need for surgical re‐intervention (11.6% versus 10.3%). Only seven studies clearly distinguished clinically significant pancreatic fistula which required a change in the patient's management. We are uncertain whether PJ improves the risk of clinically significant pancreatic fistula when compared with PG (19.3% versus 12.8%). PJ probably has little or no difference from PG in rates of death (3.9% versus 4.8%) or complications (46.5% versus 44.5%). The risk of postoperative bleeding in participants undergoing PJ was slightly lower than those undergoing PG (9.3% versus 13.8%), but this benefit appeared to be balanced with a higher risk of developing an abdominal abscess in PJ participants (14.7% versus 8.0%). Only one study reported quality of life; PG may be better than PJ in some quality of life parameters. Cost data were not reported in any studies. Quality of the evidence Most studies had flaws in methodological quality, reporting or both. Overall, the quality of evidence was low.},

abstract = {Abstract - Background Secondary peritonitis is associated with a high mortality rate and if not treated successfully leads to development of abscesses, severe sepsis and multi‐organ failure. Source control and adjunctive antibiotics are the mainstay of treatment. However, no conclusive evidence suggest that one antibiotic regimen is better than any other but at the same time have a lower toxicity. Objectives To ascertain the efficacy and adverse effects of different antibiotic regimens in treating intra‐abdominal infections in adults. Outcomes were divided into primary (clinical success and effectiveness in reducing mortality) and secondary (microbiological success, preventing wound infection, intra‐abdominal abscess, clinical sepsis, remote infection, superinfection, adverse reactions, duration of treatment required, effectiveness in reducing hospitalised stay, and time to defervescence). Search methods We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (Cochrane Library, Issue 4, 2004), MEDLINE (from 1966 to November 2004), EMBASE (from 1980 to November 2004) and Cochrane Colorectal Cancer Group specialised register SR‐COLOCA.   Bibliographies of identified studies were screened for further relevant trials. Selection criteria Randomised and quasi‐randomised controlled trials comparing different antibiotic regimens in the treatment of secondary peritonitis in adults were selected. Trials reporting gynaecological or traumatic peritonitis were excluded from this review. Ambiguity regarding suitability of trials were discussed among the review team. Data collection and analysis Six reviewers independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. Data collection was standardised using data collection form to ensure uniformity among reviewers. Statistical analyses were performed using the random effects model and the results expressed as odds ratio for dichotomous outcomes, or weight mean difference for continuous data with 95% confidence intervals. Main results Fourty studies with 5094 patients met the inclusion criteria. Sixteen different comparative antibiotic regimens were reported. All antibiotics showed equivocal comparability in terms of clinical success. Mortality did not differ between the regimens. Despite the potential high toxicity profile of regimens using aminoglycosides, this was not demonstrated in this review. The reason for this could be the inherent bias within clinical trials in the form of patient selection and stringency in monitoring drug levels. Authors' conclusions No specific recommendations can be made for the first line treatment of secondary peritonitis in adults with antibiotics, as all regimens showed equivocal efficacy. Other factors such as local guidelines and preferences, ease of administration, costs and availability must therefore be taken into consideration in deciding the antibiotic regimen of choice. Future trials should attempt to stratify patients and perform intention‐to‐treat analysis to allow better external validity. Plain language summary Antibiotics are effective in preventing post‐operative complications following infection of the peritoneum (peritonitis), but there is no evidence to support that one regimen is superior to another, and at the same time has less side effects. Patients with peritonitis originated from the gut will often require surgery. Antibiotics are useful in the treatment of the ongoing infection and for prevention of post‐operative complications.   This review does not result in specific recommendations for any antibiotic regimen for the first line treatment of secondary peritonitis in adults, as all regimens showed equivocal efficacy. Other factors such as local guidelines and preferences, ease of administration, costs and availability must therefore be taken into consideration in deciding the antibiotic regimen of choice. More large scale trials are needed, and future trials should attempt to stratify patients and perform intention‐to‐treat analysis to allow better external validity.},

abstract = {Abstract - Background Gastrectomy remains the primary therapeutic method for resectable gastric cancer. Thought of as an important measure to reduce post‐operative complications and mortality, abdominal drainage has been used widely after gastrectomy for gastric cancer in previous decades. The benefits of abdominal drainage have been questioned by researchers in recent years. Objectives The objectives of this review were to assess the benefits and harms of routine abdominal drainage post‐gastrectomy for gastric cancer. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Upper Gastrointestinal and Pancreatic Diseases (UGPD) Group Specialised Register and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in  The Cochrane Library  (2014, Issue 11); MEDLINE (via PubMed) (1950 to November 2014); EMBASE (1980 to November 2014); and the Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) Database (1979 to November 2014). Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing an abdominal drain versus no drain in patients who had undergone gastrectomy (not considering the scale of gastrectomy and the extent of lymphadenectomy); irrespective of language, publication status, and the type of drain. We excluded RCTs comparing one drain with another. Data collection and analysis We adhered to the standard methodological procedures of The Cochrane Collaboration. From each included trial, we extracted the data on the methodological quality and characteristics of the participants, mortality (30‐day mortality), re‐operations, post‐operative complications (pneumonia, wound infection, intra‐abdominal abscess, anastomotic leak, drain‐related complications), operation time, length of post‐operative hospital stay, and initiation of a soft diet. For dichotomous data, we calculated the risk ratio (RR) and 95% confidence interval (CI). For continuous data, we calculated mean difference (MD) and 95% CI. We tested heterogeneity using the Chi 2  test. We used a fixed‐effect model for data analysis with RevMan software, but we used a random‐effects model if the P value of the Chi 2  test was less than 0.1. Main results We included four RCTs involving 438 patients (220 patients in the drain group and 218 in the no‐drain group). There was no evidence of a difference between the two groups in mortality (RR 1.73, 95% CI 0.38 to 7.84); re‐operations (RR 2.49, 95% CI 0.71 to 8.74); post‐operative complications (pneumonia: RR 1.18, 95% CI 0.55 to 2.54; wound infection: RR 1.23, 95% CI 0.47 to 3.23; intra‐abdominal abscess: RR 1.27, 95% CI 0.29 to 5.51; anastomotic leak: RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.06 to 14.47); or initiation of soft diet (MD 0.15 days, 95% CI ‐0.07 to 0.37). However, the addition of a drain prolonged the operation time (MD 9.07 min, 95% CI 2.56 to 15.57) and post‐operative hospital stay (MD 0.69 day, 95% CI 0.18 to 1.21) and led to drain‐related complications. Additionally, we should note that 30‐day mortality and re‐operations are very rare events and, as a result, very large numbers of patients would be required to make any sensible conclusions about whether the two groups were similar. The overall quality of the evidence according to the GRADE approach was 'very low' for mortality and re‐operations, and 'low' for post‐operative complications, operation time, and post‐operative length of stay. Authors' conclusions We found no convincing evidence to support routine drain use after gastrectomy for gastric cancer. Plain language summary Inserting a drain after gastrectomy for gastric cancer Background Gastrectomy remains the primary therapeutic method for resectable gastric cancer. It is believed that abdominal drains can help in the earlier detection and drainage of anastomotic fistulas and the prevention of intra‐abdominal abscesses. There is no consensus on the routine placement of abdominal drainage after gastrectomy for gastric cancer. Review question To assess the benefits and harms of routine abdominal drainage post‐gastrectomy for gastric cancer, we included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared inserting an abdominal drain versus no drain in patients with gastric cancer who had undergone gastrectomy. The main outcomes included deaths (30‐day mortality), re‐operations, post‐operative complications, operation time, length of post‐operative hospital stay, and time of initiation of a soft diet. Study characteristics This review included four RCTs involving 438 patients that investigated the benefits and harms of routine abdominal drainage post‐gastrectomy for gastric cancer. Key results There was no evidence of a difference between the two groups in deaths, post‐operative complications, and initiation of a soft diet. The results showed that drains increased harms by prolonging operation time and post‐operative hospital stay, and led to drain‐related complications without providing any additional benefit for patients with gastric cancer undergoing gastrectomy. There was no convincing evidence to support the routine use of drains after gastrectomy for gastric cancer. Quality of the evidence The overall quality of the evidence according to the GRADE approach was 'very low' for deaths and re‐operations, and 'low' for post‐operative complications, operation time, and post‐operative length of stay. This review included only four RCTs, and not all of the included studies reported all outcomes that we were assessing. Therefore, the quality was mainly limited by insufficient data.},

abstract = {Abstract - Background Following surgery, incisions are usually closed by fixing the edges together with sutures (stitches), staples, adhesives (glue) or clips. This process helps the cut edges heal together and is called 'healing by primary intention'. However, a minority of surgical wounds are not closed in this way. Where the risk of infection is high or there has been significant loss of tissue, wounds may be left open to heal by the growth of new tissue rather than by primary closure; this is known as 'healing by secondary intention'. There is a risk of infection in open wounds, which may impact on wound healing, and antiseptic or antibiotic treatments may be used with the aim of preventing or treating such infections. This review is one of a suite of Cochrane reviews investigating the evidence on antiseptics and antibiotics in different types of wounds. It aims to present current evidence related to the use of antiseptics and antibiotics for surgical wounds healing by secondary intention (SWHSI). Objectives To assess the effects of systemic and topical antibiotics, and topical antiseptics for the treatment of surgical wounds healing by secondary intention. Search methods In November 2015 we searched: The Cochrane Wounds Specialised Register; The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) ( The Cochrane Library ); Ovid MEDLINE; Ovid MEDLINE (In‐Process & Other Non‐Indexed Citations); Ovid EMBASE and EBSCO CINAHL. We also searched three clinical trials registries and the references of included studies and relevant systematic reviews. There were no restrictions with respect to language, date of publication or study setting. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials which enrolled adults with a surgical wound healing by secondary intention and assessed treatment with an antiseptic or antibiotic treatment. Studies enrolling people with skin graft donor sites were not included, neither were studies of wounds with a non‐surgical origin which had subsequently undergone sharp or surgical debridement or other surgical treatments or wounds within the oral or aural cavities. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently performed study selection, risk of bias assessment and data extraction. Main results Eleven studies with a total of 886 participants were included in the review. These evaluated a range of comparisons in a range of surgical wounds healing by secondary intention. In general studies were small and some did not present data or analyses that could be easily interpreted or related to clinical outcomes. These factors reduced the quality of the evidence. Two comparisons compared different iodine preparations with no antiseptic treatment and found no clear evidence of effects for these treatments. The outcome data available were limited and what evidence there was low quality. One study compared a zinc oxide mesh dressing with a plain mesh dressing. There was no clear evidence of a difference in time to wound healing between groups. There was some evidence of a difference in measures used to assess wound infection (wound with foul smell and number of participants prescribed antibiotics) which favoured the zinc oxide group. This was low quality evidence. One study reported that sucralfate cream increased the likelihood of healing open wounds following haemorrhoidectomy compared to a petrolatum cream (RR: 1.50, 95% CI 1.13 to 1.99) over a three week period. This evidence was graded as being of moderate quality. The study also reported lower wound pain scores in the sucralfate group. There was a reduction in time to healing of open wounds following haemorrhoidectomy when treated with Triclosan post‐operatively compared with a standard sodium hypochlorite solution (mean difference ‐1.70 days, 95% CI ‐3.41 to 0.01). This was classed as low quality evidence. There was moderate quality evidence that more open wounds resulting from excision of pyomyositis abscesses healed when treated with a honey‐soaked gauze compared with a EUSOL‐soaked gauze over three weeks' follow‐up (RR: 1.58, 95% CI 1.03 to 2.42). There was also some evidence of a reduction in the mean length of hospital stay in the honey group. Evidence was taken from one small study that only had 43 participants. There was moderate quality evidence that more Dermacym®‐treated post‐operative foot wounds in people with diabetes healed compared to those treated with iodine (RR 0.61, 95% CI 0.40 to 0.93). Again estimates came from one small study with 40 participants. Authors' conclusions There is no robust evidence on the relative effectiveness of any antiseptic/antibiotic/anti‐bacterial preparation evaluated to date for use on SWHSI. Where some evidence for possible treatment effects was reported, it stemmed from single studies with small participant numbers and was classed as moderate or low quality evidence. This means it is likely or very likely that further research will have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect, and may change this estimate. Plain language summary Antibiotics and antiseptics for surgical wounds healing by secondary intention What are surgical wounds healing by secondary intention? These are surgical wounds which are left open to heal through the growth of new tissue, rather than being closed in the usual way with stitches or other methods which bring the wound edges together. This is usually done when there is a high risk of infection or a large amount of tissue has been lost from the wound. Wounds which are often treated in this way include chronic wounds in the cleft between the buttocks (pilonidal sinuses) and some types of abscesses. Why use antibiotics and antiseptics to treat surgical wounds healing by secondary intention? One reason for allowing a wound to heal by secondary intention after surgery is that the risk of infection in that wound is thought to be high. If a wound has already become infected, then antibiotics or antiseptics are used to kill or slow the growth of the micro‐organisms causing the infection and prevent it from getting worse or spreading. This may also help the wound to heal. Even where wounds are not clearly infected, they usually have populations of micro‐organisms present. It is thought that they may heal better if these populations are reduced by antibacterial agents. However, the relationship between infection and micro‐organism populations in wounds and wound healing is not very clear. What we found In November 2015 we searched for as many studies as possible that both had a randomised controlled design and looked at the use of an antibiotic or antiseptic in participants with surgical wounds healing by secondary intention. We found 11 studies which included a total of 886 participants.These all looked at different comparisons. Several different types of wounds were included. Studies looked at wounds after diabetic foot amputation, pilonidal sinus surgery, treatment of various types of abscess, surgery for haemorrhoids, complications after caesarean section and healing of openings created by operations such as colostomy. Most studies compared a range of different types of antibacterial treatments to treatments without antibacterial activity, but four compared different antibacterial treatments. Although some of the trials suggested that one treatment may be better than another, this evidence was limited by the size of the studies and the ways they were carried out and reported. All of the studies had low numbers of participants and in some cases these numbers were very small. Many of the studies did not report important information about how they were carried out, so it was difficult to tell whether the results presented were likely to be true. More, better quality, research is needed to find out the effects of antimicrobial treatments on surgical wounds which are healing by secondary intention. Assessed as up to date November 2015.},

abstract = {Abstract - Background Undifferentiated acute respiratory infections (ARIs) are a large and heterogeneous group of infections not clearly restricted to one specific part of the upper respiratory tract, which last for up to seven days. They are more common in pre‐school children in low‐income countries and are responsible for 75% of the total amount of prescribed antibiotics in high‐income countries. One possible rationale for prescribing antibiotics is the wish to prevent bacterial complications. Objectives To assess the effectiveness and safety of antibiotics in preventing bacterial complications in children aged two months to 59 months with undifferentiated ARIs. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2015, Issue 7), which contains the Cochrane Acute Respiratory Infections Group's Specialised Register, MEDLINE (1950 to August week 1, 2015) and EMBASE (1974 to August 2015). Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi‐RCTs comparing antibiotic prescriptions with placebo or no treatment in children aged two months to 59 months with an undifferentiated ARI for up to seven days. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted and analysed data using the standard Cochrane methodological procedures. Main results We identified four trials involving 1314 children. Three trials investigated the use of amoxicillin/clavulanic acid to prevent otitis and one investigated ampicillin to prevent pneumonia. The use of amoxicillin/clavulanic acid compared to placebo to prevent otitis showed a risk ratio (RR) of 0.70 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.45 to 1.11, three trials, 414 selected children, moderate‐quality evidence). Methods of random sequence generation and allocation concealment were not clearly stated in two trials. Performance, detection and reporting bias could not be ruled out in three trials. Ampicillin compared to supportive care (continuation of breastfeeding, clearing of the nose and paracetamol for fever control) to prevent pneumonia showed a RR of 1.05 (95% CI 0.74 to 1.49, one trial, 889 selected children, moderate‐quality evidence). The trial was non‐blinded. Random sequence generation and allocation concealment methods were not clearly stated, so the possibility of reporting bias could not be ruled out. Harm outcomes could not be analysed as they were expressed only in percentages. We found no studies assessing mastoiditis, quinsy, abscess, meningitis, hospital admission or death. Authors' conclusions There is insufficient evidence for antibiotic use as a means of reducing the risk of otitis or pneumonia in children up to five years of age with undifferentiated ARIs. Further high‐quality research is needed to provide more definitive evidence of the effectiveness of antibiotics in this population. Plain language summary Antibiotics for common respiratory infections with unclear causes and undifferentiated symptoms in children up to five years of age Review question   Do antibiotics prevent more severe infections in children up to five years old with common upper acute respiratory infections (ARIs)? Background   Common upper ARIs are a large and varied groups of infections. They occur in any part of the upper respiratory system, last for up to seven days and have a wide variety of causes. They may lead to complications such as ear, throat and sinus infections. More common in pre‐school children, they are the most frequent reason for parents to seek medical assistance. Furthermore, they are responsible for 75% of the total prescribed antibiotics in high‐income countries. One possible rationale for prescribing antibiotics is the wish to prevent bacterial complications. Methods   This review focuses on the use of antibiotics to prevent clinical bacterial complications in children up to five years of age with common and undifferentiated ARIs. This is an update of a review previously published in 2014. The evidence is current to August 2015. In this update we retrieved 616 new studies, but none met our inclusion criteria. Studies characteristics   We included four trials (1314 children) in this review. Three trials (414 children, during seven days) investigated the use of an antibiotic (amoxicillin/clavulanic acid) to prevent otitis media. One trial (889 children, during two weeks) investigated the use of another antibiotic (ampicillin) to prevent pneumonia. Only one trial addressed harms. However, we could not analyse the data as it was expressed in percentages rather then absolute terms. No studies assessed other severe complications (mastoiditis, quinsy, abscess, meningitis), hospital admission or death. Key results   Current evidence does not provide support for the use of antibiotics to prevent otitis media and pneumonia in children up to five years of age with common upper ARIs. Quality of the evidence   In the trials treating otitis media, the quality of the evidence was moderate as the methods for avoiding bias were not clearly stated. Furthermore, in one trial a pharmaceutical company prepared the placebo syrup used in the trial. In the study treating pneumonia, we classified the quality of the evidence as moderate, because the families previously knew if their children were receiving antibiotics or not. Furthermore, the methods for avoiding bias were not clearly stated by the trial authors. Further high‐quality research is needed to provide more definitive evidence of the effectiveness of antibiotics in this population.},

ISSN = {1465-1858},
abstract = {Abstract - Background Ileocolic anastomoses are commonly performed for right‐sided colon cancer and Crohn's disease. The anastomosis may be constructed using a linear cutter stapler or by suturing. Individual trials comparing stapled versus handsewn ileocolic anastomoses have found little difference in the complication rate but they have lacked adequate power to detect potential small difference. This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2007. Objectives To compare outcomes of ileocolic anastomoses performed using stapling and handsewn techniques. The hypothesis tested was that the stapling technique is associated with fewer complications. Search methods MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Colorectal Cancer Group specialised register SR‐COLOCA, Cochrane Library were searched for randomised controlled trials comparing use of a linear cuter stapler with any type of suturing technique for ileocolic anastomoses in adults from 1970 to 2005 and were updated in December 2010. Abstracts presented to the following society meetings between 1970 and 2010 were handsearched: American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons, the Association of Coloproctology of Great Britain and Ireland, European Association of Coloproctology. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials comparing use of linear cutter stapler (isoperistaltic side to side or functional end to end) with any type of suturing technique in adults. Data collection and analysis Eligible studies were selected and their methodological quality assessed. Relevant results were extracted and missing data sought from the authors. RevMan 5 was used to perform meta‐analysis when there were sufficient data. Sub‐group analyses for cancer inflammatory bowel disease as indication for ileocolic anastomoses were performed. Main results After obtaining individual data from authors for studies that include other anastomoses, seven trials (including one unpublished) with 1125 ileocolic participants (441 stapled, 684 handsewn) were included. The five largest trials had adequate allocation concealment. Stapled anastomosis was associated with significantly fewer anastomotic leaks compared with handsewn (S=11/441, HS=42/684, OR 0.48 [0.24, 0.95] p=0.03). One study performed routine radiology to detect asymptomatic leaks. For the sub‐group of 825 cancer patients in four studies, stapled anastomosis led to significantly fewer anastomotic leaks (S=4/300, HS=35/525, OR 0.28 [0.10, 0.75] p=0.01). In subgroup analysis of non‐cancer patients (3 studies, 264 patients) there were no differences for any reported outcomes. All other outcomes: stricture, anastomotic haemorrhage, anastomotic time, re‐operation, mortality, intra‐abdominal abscess, wound infection, length of stay, showed no significant difference. Authors' conclusions Stapled functional end to end ileocolic anastomosis is associated with fewer leaks than handsewn anastomosis. Plain language summary A comparison of two methods to join small and large bowel together in surgery Surgery for right‐sided bowel cancer or Crohn's disease commonly involve removing a segment of bowel and re‐joining the small and large bowel together. The join, or anastomosis, can be made by stapling or sewing. This systematic review found seven randomised controlled trials with a total of 1125 participants (441 stapled, 684 handsewn) comparing these two methods. The leak rate from the bowel join for stapled anastomosis was 2.5%, significantly lower than handsewn (6%). For the sub‐group of 825 cancer patients in four studies, stapled join again has fewer leaks compared with handsewn, being 1.3% and 6.7% respectively. For the sub‐group of 264 non‐cancer patients in three studies, there were no differences for the reported outcomes. This sub‐group included patients with Crohn's disease. Overall, there was no significant difference in the other outcomes of stricture, bleeding from the join, time to perform the join, re‐operation, mortality, intra‐abdominal abscess, wound infection and length of stay, although these were not consistently reported. The reason why a handsewn bowel join is more likely to leak is unclear. Possible explanations include less handling of the bowel, decreased spillage of bowel content during surgery, and uniform closure of all the staples using a stapler. This review did not compare different sewing materials or methods. The trials included in this review were performed from the early 1980's to 2009 involving six countries. The studies in Crohn's disease were more recent but the combined number of patients was too small to summarise outcomes. More randomised controlled trials comparing the two surgical techniques in Crohn's disease are needed.},

abstract = {Abstract - Background Breast engorgement is a painful condition affecting large numbers of women in the early postpartum period. It may lead to premature weaning, cracked nipples, mastitis and breast abscess. Various forms of treatment for engorgement have been studied but so far little evidence has been found on an effective intervention. Objectives This is an update of a systematic review first published by Snowden et al. in 2001 and subsequently published in 2010. The objective of this update is to seek new information on the best forms of treatment for breast engorgement in lactating women. Search methods We identified studies for inclusion through the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (30 June 2015) and searched reference lists of retrieved studies. Selection criteria Randomised and quasi‐randomised controlled trials. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently assessed trials for eligibility, extracted data and conducted 'Risk of bias' assessments. Where insufficient data were presented in trial reports, we attempted to contact study authors and obtain necessary information. We assessed the quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach. Main results In total, we included 13 studies with 919 women. In 10 studies individual women were the unit of analysis and in three studies, individual breasts were the unit of analysis. Four out of 13 studies were funded by an agency with a commercial interest, two received charitable funding, and two were funded by government agencies. Trials examined interventions including non‐medical treatments: cabbage leaves (three studies), acupuncture (two studies), ultrasound (one study), acupressure (one study), scraping therapy ( Gua Sha ) (one study), cold breast‐packs and electromechanical massage (one study), and medical treatments: serrapeptase (one study), protease (one study) and subcutaneous oxytocin (one study). The studies were small and used different comparisons with only single studies contributing data to outcomes of this review. We were unable to pool results in meta‐analysis and only seven studies provided outcome data that could be included in data and analysis. Non‐medical No differences were observed in the one study comparing acupuncture with usual care (advice and oxytocin spray) (risk ratio (RR) 0.50, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.13 to 1.92; one study; 140 women) in terms of  cessation of breastfeeding . However, women in the acupuncture group were less likely to develop an  abscess  (RR 0.20, 95% CI 0.04 to 1.01; one study; 210 women), had less severe symptoms on day five (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.70 to 0.99), and had a lower rate of  pyrexia  (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.72 to 0.94) than women in the usual care group. In another study with 39 women comparing cabbage leaf extract with placebo, no differences were observed in  breast pain  (mean difference (MD) 0.40, 95% CI ‐0.67 to 1.47;  low‐quality evidence ) or  breast engorgement  (MD 0.20, 95% CI ‐0.18 to 0.58;  low‐quality evidence ). There was no difference between ultrasound and sham treatment in  analgesic requirement  (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.51; one study; 45 women;  low‐quality evidence ). A study comparing Gua‐Sha therapy with hot packs and massage found a marked difference in  breast engorgement  (MD ‐2.42, 95% CI ‐2.98 to ‐1.86; one study; 54 women),  breast pain  (MD ‐2.01, 95% CI ‐2.60 to ‐1.42; one study; 54 women) and  breast discomfort  (MD ‐2.33, 95% CI ‐2.81 to ‐1.85; one study; 54 women) in favour of Gua‐Sha therapy five minutes post‐intervention, though both interventions significantly decreased breast temperature, engorgement, pain and discomfort at five and 30 minutes post‐treatment. Results from individual trials that could not be included in data analysis suggested that there were no differences between room temperature and chilled cabbage leaves and between chilled cabbage leaves and gel packs, with all interventions producing some relief. Intermittent hot/cold packs applied for 20 minutes twice a day were found to be more effective than acupressure (P < 0.001). Acupuncture did not improve maternal satisfaction with breastfeeding. In another study, women who received breast‐shaped cold packs were more likely to experience a reduction in pain intensity than women who received usual care; however, the differences between groups at baseline, and the failure to observe randomisation, make this study at high risk of bias. One study found a decrease in breast temperature (P = 0.03) following electromechanical massage and pumping in comparison to manual methods; however, the high level of attrition and alternating method of sequence generation place this study at high risk of bias. Medical Women treated with protease complex were less likely to have no improvement in  pain  (RR 0.17, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.74; one study; 59 women) and  swelling  (RR 0.34, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.79; one study; 59 women) on the fourth day of treatment and less likely to experience no overall change in their symptoms or worsening of symptoms (RR 0.26, 95% CI 0.12 to 0.56). It should be noted that it is more than 40 years since the study was carried out, and we are not aware that this preparation is used in current practice. Subcutaneous oxytocin provided  no relief at all in symptoms  at three days (RR 3.13, 95% CI 0.68 to 14.44; one study; 45 women). Serrapeptase was found to produce some relief in breast pain, induration and swelling, when compared to placebo, with a fewer number of women experiencing slight to no improvement in overall  breast engorgement ,  swelling  and  breast pain. Overall, the risk of bias of studies in the review is high. The overall quality as assessed using the GRADE approach was found to be low due to limitations in study design and the small number of women in the included studies, with only single studies providing data for analysis. Authors' conclusions Although some interventions such as hot/cold packs, Gua‐Sha (scraping therapy), acupuncture, cabbage leaves and proteolytic enzymes may be promising for the treatment of breast engorgement during lactation, there is insufficient evidence from published trials on any intervention to justify widespread implementation. More robust research is urgently needed on the treatment of breast engorgement. Plain language summary Treatment for breast engorgement (overfull, hard, painful breasts) in breastfeeding women Review question What are the best forms of treatment for engorged breasts in breastfeeding women? Background Breast engorgement is the overfilling of breasts with milk leading to swollen, hard and painful breasts. Many women experience this during the first few days after giving birth, although it can occur later. It is more common when the timing of breastfeeding is restricted or the baby has difficulty sucking or the mother is separated from her newborn. This leads to the breasts not being emptied properly. Breast engorgement may make it difficult for women to breastfeed. It may lead to complications such as inflammation of the breast, infection and sore/cracked nipples. So far, consistent evidence for effective forms of treatment is lacking. Study characteristics We searched for trials on any treatments for breast engorgement in breastfeeding women. We looked at 13 trials including 919 breastfeeding women who had engorged breasts. The trials looked at treatments including acupuncture, acupressure, cabbage leaves, cold packs, medication, massage and ultrasound. Four of the studies were funded by an agency with a commercial interest in the results of the studies, two received charitable funding and two were funded by government agencies. The other five did not declare the source of funding. Results One study comparing acupuncture with usual care (advice and oxytocin spray) found no difference in terms of stopping breastfeeding. However, women in the acupuncture group were less likely to develop an abscess, had less severe symptoms on day five and had a lower rate of fever than women in the usual care group. Three trials looking at cabbage leaves showed no difference between room temperature and chilled cabbage leaves, between chilled cabbage leaves and gel packs and between cabbage cream and the inactive cream; however, all forms of treatment provided some relief. Hot/cold packs were found to be more effective than acupressure.  Gua Sha  scraping therapy was found to be more effective than hot packs and massage in reducing symptoms of breast engorgement, though both forms of treatment decreased breast temperature, engorgement, pain and discomfort at five and 30 minutes after treatment. A study on ultrasound therapy had the same, minimal effect as the fake ultrasound, whereas oxytocin injections in another study provided no relief at all. When breast‐shaped cold gel packs were compared with routine care, women who used gel packs seemed to have less pain; however, the study was of very low quality making the results unreliable. Quality of evidence The quality of evidence was low due to the small number of participants in the included studies and limited number of studies looking at the same outcomes. More robust research is urgently needed on the treatment of breast engorgement.},

abstract = {Abstract - Background Perforated peptic ulcer is a common abdominal disease that is treated by surgery. The development of laparoscopic surgery has changed the way to treat such abdominal surgical emergencies. The results of some clinical trials suggest that laparoscopic surgery could be a better strategy than open surgery in the correction of perforated peptic ulcer but the evidence is not strongly in favour for or against this intervention. Objectives To measure the effect of laparoscopic surgical treatment versus open surgical treatment in patients with a diagnosis of perforated peptic ulcer in relation to abdominal septic complications, surgical wound infection, extra‐abdominal complications, hospital length of stay and direct costs. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) on  The Cochrane Library  (2004, Issue 2), PubMed/MEDLINE (1966 to July 2004), EMBASE (1985 to November 2004) and LILACS (1988 to November 2004) as well as the reference lists of relevant articles. Searches in all databases were updated in December 2009 and January 2012. We did not confine our search to English language publications. Selection criteria Randomized clinical trials comparing laparoscopic surgery versus open surgery for the repair of perforated peptic ulcer using any mechanical method of closure (suture, omental patch or fibrin sealant). Data collection and analysis Primary outcome measures included proportion of septic and other abdominal complications (surgical site infection, suture leakage, intra‐abdominal abscess, postoperative ileus) and extra‐abdominal complications (pulmonary). Secondary outcomes included mortality, time to return to normal diet, time of nasogastric aspiration, hospital length‐of‐stay and costs. Outcomes were summarized by reporting odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs), using the fixed‐effect model. Main results We included three randomized clinical trials of acceptable quality. We found no statistically significant differences between laparoscopic and open surgery in the proportion of abdominal septic complications (OR 0.66; 95% CI 0.30 to 1.47), pulmonary complications (OR 0.52; 95% CI 0.08 to 3.55) or number of septic abdominal complications (OR 0.60; 95% CI 0.32 to 1.15). Heterogeneity was significant for pulmonary complications and operating time. Authors' conclusions This review suggests that a decrease in septic abdominal complications may exist when laparoscopic surgery is used to correct perforated peptic ulcer. However, it is necessary to perform more randomized controlled trials with a greater number of patients to confirm such an assumption, guaranteeing a long learning curve for participating surgeons. With the information provided it could be said that laparoscopic surgery results are not clinically different from those of open surgery. Plain language summary Laparoscopic (minimally invasive) repair for perforated peptic ulcer disease A perforated peptic ulcer can be repaired using either open surgery or laparoscopy, a minimally invasive surgical technique sometimes known as 'keyhole' surgery. Three randomized controlled trials were identified that compared the two methods. These trials included patients with clinical suspicion of perforated peptic ulcer that was confirmed at surgery. Both laparoscopic and open repairs were made with an omentum patch or fibrin sealant. The primary outcomes assessed were septic abdominal and extra‐abdominal complications. Secondary outcomes assessed were mortality, operation time and hospital length of stay. The quality of the trials was acceptable. There were no statistically significant differences in septic abdominal complications between laparoscopic and open repair of perforated peptic ulcer. More randomized controlled trials with a greater number of patients are needed to confirm such an assumption, guaranteeing a long learning curve for participating surgeons.},

abstract = {Abstract - Background Sore throat is a common condition associated with a high rate of antibiotic prescriptions, despite limited evidence for the effectiveness of antibiotics. Corticosteroids may improve symptoms of sore throat by reducing inflammation of the upper respiratory tract. Objectives To assess the clinical benefit and safety of corticosteroids for symptoms of sore throat in adults and children. Search methods We searched  The Cochrane Library , the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2012, Issue 5) which includes the Acute Respiratory Infections (ARI) Group's Specialised Register, the Database of Reviews of Effects and the NHS Health Economics Database, MEDLINE (1966 to November Week 4, 2012) and EMBASE (1974 to June 2012). Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials that compared steroids to either placebo or standard care in adults and children (older than three years of age) with sore throat. We excluded studies of hospitalised participants, those with infectious mononucleosis, sore throat following tonsillectomy or intubation, or peritonsillar abscess. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently reviewed and selected trials from searches, assessed and rated study quality, and extracted relevant data. Main results We included eight trials involving 743 participants (369 children and 374 adults). All trials gave antibiotics to both placebo and corticosteroid groups; no trials assessed corticosteroids as standalone treatment for sore throat. In addition to any effect of antibiotics and analgesia, corticosteroids increased the likelihood of complete resolution of pain at 24 hours by more than three times (risk ratio (RR) 3.2, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.0 to 5.1, P < 0.001, I 2  statistic 44%) and at 48 hours by 1.7 times. Fewer than four people need to be treated to prevent one person continuing to experience pain at 24 hours. Corticosteroids also reduced the mean time to onset of pain relief and the mean time to complete resolution of pain by 6 and 14 hours, respectively, although significant heterogeneity was present. At 24 hours, pain (assessed by visual analogue scores) was reduced by an additional 14% by corticosteroids. No difference in rates of recurrence, relapse or adverse events were reported for participants taking corticosteroids compared to placebo, although reporting of adverse events was poor. Authors' conclusions Oral or intramuscular corticosteroids, in addition to antibiotics, increase the likelihood of both resolution and improvement of pain in participants with sore throat. Further trials assessing corticosteroids in the absence of antibiotics and in children are warranted. Plain language summary Corticosteroids as standalone or add‐on treatment for sore throat Sore throat is a common condition. Patients often receive antibiotics for sore throat, which is thought to contribute to resistance to antibiotics in individuals and the community. Sore throats are painful because of the inflammation of the lining of the throat. Corticosteroids reduce inflammation and because they act on the upper respiratory tract in other conditions, may also be beneficial in sore throat. This systematic review combined the results of eight trials which looked at this question, including a total of 743 participants. Patients taking corticosteroids were three times more likely to experience complete resolution of their sore throat symptoms by 24 hours compared to those taking placebo. In addition, corticosteroids improved the time to onset of symptom relief and the time to complete resolution of symptoms, although the trials were not consistent for these outcomes. Adverse events, relapse rates and recurrence rates were not different for corticosteroid compared to placebo groups. Limitations of the review include the absence of any trials set in Europe and the fact that only two trials addressed the question in children. As all the included trials also gave antibiotics to all participants, we recommend that future research should examine the benefit of corticosteroids in patients who are not also taking antibiotics.},

abstract = {Abstract - Background Cholecystectomy is the removal of gallbladder and is performed mainly for symptomatic gallstones. Although laparoscopic cholecystectomy is currently preferred over open cholecystectomy for elective cholecystectomy, reports of randomised clinical trials comparing the choice of cholecystectomy (open or laparoscopic) in acute cholecystitis are still being conducted. Drainage in open cholecystectomy is a matter of considerable debate. Surgeons use drains primarily to prevent subhepatic abscess or bile peritonitis from an undrained bile leak. Critics of drain condemn drain use as it increases wound and chest infection. Objectives To assess the benefits and harms of routine abdominal drainage in uncomplicated open cholecystectomy. Search methods We searched  The Cochrane Hepato‐Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register , the  Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL)  in  The Cochrane Library ,  MEDLINE ,  EMBASE , and  Science Citation Index Expanded  until April 2006. Selection criteria We included randomised clinical trials comparing 'no drain' versus 'drain' in patients who had undergone uncomplicated open cholecystectomy (irrespective of language, publication status, and the type of drain). Randomised clinical trials comparing one drain with another were also included. Data collection and analysis We collected the data on the characteristics and methodological quality of each trial, number of abdominal collections requiring different treatments, bile peritonitis, wound infection, chest complications, and hospital stay from each trial. We analysed the data with both the fixed‐effect and the random‐effects models using RevMan Analysis. For each outcome, we calculated the odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) based on intention‐to‐treat analysis. Main results Twenty eight trials involving 3659 patients were included. There were 20 comparisons of 'no drain' versus 'drain' and 12 comparisons of one drain with another. There was no statistically significant difference in mortality, bile peritonitis, total abdominal collections, abdominal collections requiring different treatments, or infected abdominal collections. 'No drain' group had statistically significant lower wound infection (OR 0.61, 95% CI 0.43 to 0.87) and statistically significant lower chest infection (OR 0.59, 95% CI 0.42 to 0.84) than drain group. We found no significant differences between different types of drains. Authors' conclusions Drains increase the harms to the patient without providing any additional benefit for patients undergoing open cholecystectomy and should be avoided in open cholecystectomy. Plain language summary Drains increase the harms to patients undergoing open cholecystectomy Cholecystectomy is the removal of the gallbladder. It is performed mainly in patients having symptomatic gallstones. Drain usage after open cholecystectomy is controversial. The present review includes 28 trials assessing 20 comparisons of 'no drain' versus 'drain' and 12 comparisons of different drain types. The review reports that drains increase the harms to the patient. Drains do not provide any additional benefit for patients undergoing open cholecystectomy and should be avoided in open cholecystectomy. The review found no significant differences between different drain types.},

abstract = {Abstract - Background Postoperative morbidity and mortality are high in patients undergoing pancreatico‐duodenectomy for malignant pancreatico‐biliary stricture. Different approaches have been tried to improve the outcomes, including pre‐surgical biliary stenting with endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreaticography (ERCP). Objectives To assess the beneficial and harmful effects of biliary stenting via ERCP for pancreatico‐biliary stricture confirmed or suspected to be malignant, prior to surgery. Search methods We identified trials through  The Cochrane Hepato‐Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register  (October 2006), the  Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials  ( CENTRAL ) in  The Cochrane Library  (Issue 2, 2006),  MEDLINE  (1950 to October 2006),  EMBASE  (1980 to October 2006), and  Science Citation Index Expanded  (1945 to October 2006). We also searched the references in the published papers and wrote to stent producers. Selection criteria Randomised trials comparing ERCP with biliary stenting versus ERCP without biliary stenting for pancreatico‐biliary malignancy prior to surgery. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently selected trials for inclusion and extracted data. The primary pre‐surgical, post‐surgical, and final outcome measures were mortality. The secondary outcomes were complications such as cholangitis, pancreatitis, bleeding, pancreatic fistula, intra‐abdominal abscess, improvement in bilirubin, and quality of life. Dichotomous outcomes were reported as odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) based on fixed‐ and random‐effect models. Main results We identified two randomised trials with 125 patients undergoing pancreatico‐duodenectomy; 62 patients underwent ERCP with biliary stenting and 63 had ERCP without biliary stenting prior to surgery. Pre‐surgical mortality was not significantly affected by stenting (OR 3.14, 95% CI 0.12 to 79.26), while there were significantly more complications in the stented group (OR 43.75, 95% CI 2.51 to 761.8). Stenting had no significant effect on the post‐surgical mortality (OR 0.75, 95% CI 0.25 to 2.24). However, post‐surgical complications were significantly less in the stented group (OR 0.45, 95% CI 0.22 to 0.91). Overall mortality (OR 0.81, 95% CI 0.17 to 3.89) and complications (OR 0.50, 95% CI 0.01 to 23.68) were not significantly different in the two groups. Authors' conclusions We could not find convincing evidence to support or refute endoscopic biliary stenting on the mortality in patients with pancreatico‐biliary malignancy. Large randomised trials are needed to settle the question of pre‐surgical biliary stenting. Plain language summary No evidence to support or refute endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreaticography (ERCP) with stenting in patients with malignant pancreaticobiliary diseases, awaiting surgery Pancreatico‐biliary malignancy includes cancers of pancreas, ampulla, duodenum, and cholangiocarcinoma. There is significant morbidity and mortality related to surgery in these patients. Studies have claimed the beneficial role of biliary decompression, which can be performed via endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreaticography (ERCP) with stent insertion pre‐surgically. The review found that pre‐surgical biliary stenting via ERCP did not improve the morbidity and mortality in patients with pancreatico‐biliary malignancy. Further evidence about its efficiency is needed.},

abstract = {Abstract - Background The management of gallbladder stones (lithiasis) concomitant with bile duct stones is controversial. The more frequent approach is a two‐stage procedure, with endoscopic sphincterotomy and stone removal from the bile duct followed by laparoscopic cholecystectomy. The laparoscopic‐endoscopic rendezvous combines the two techniques in a single‐stage operation. Objectives To compare the benefits and harms of endoscopic sphincterotomy and stone removal followed by laparoscopic cholecystectomy (the single‐stage rendezvous technique) versus preoperative endoscopic sphincterotomy followed by laparoscopic cholecystectomy (two stages) in people with gallbladder and common bile duct stones. Search methods We searched The Cochrane Hepato‐Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE Ovid, Embase Ovid, Science Citation Index Expanded Web of Science, and two trials registers (February 2017). Selection criteria We included randomised clinical trials that enrolled people with concomitant gallbladder and common bile duct stones, regardless of clinical status or diagnostic work‐up, and compared laparoscopic‐endoscopic rendezvous versus preoperative endoscopic sphincterotomy procedures in people undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy. We excluded other endoscopic or surgical methods of intraoperative clearance of the bile duct, e.g. non‐aided intraoperative endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography or laparoscopic choledocholithotomy (surgical incision of the common bile duct for removal of bile duct stones). Data collection and analysis We used standard methodological procedures recommended by Cochrane. Main results We included five randomised clinical trials with 517 participants (257 underwent a laparoscopic‐endoscopic rendezvous technique versus 260 underwent a sequential approach), which fulfilled our inclusion criteria and provided data for analysis. Trial participants were scheduled for laparoscopic cholecystectomy because of suspected cholecysto‐choledocholithiasis. Male/female ratio was 0.7; age of men and women ranged from 21 years to 87 years. The run‐in and follow‐up periods of the trials ranged from 32 months to 84 months. Overall, the five trials were judged at high risk of bias. Athough all trials measured mortality, there was just one death reported in one trial, in the laparoscopic‐endoscopic rendezvous group (low‐quality evidence). The overall morbidity (surgical morbidity plus general morbidity) may be lower with laparoscopic rendezvous (RR 0.59, 95% CI 0.29 to 1.20; participants = 434, trials = 4; I² = 28%; low‐quality evidence); the effect was a little more certain when a fixed‐effect model was used (RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.32 to 0.99). There was insufficient evidence to determine the effects of the two approaches on the failure of primary clearance of the bile duct (RR 0.55, 95% CI 0.22 to 1.38; participants = 517; trials = 5; I² = 58%; very low‐quality evidence). The effects of either approach on clinical post‐operative pancreatitis were unclear (RR 0.29, 95% CI 0.07 to 1.12; participants = 517, trials = 5; I² = 24%; low‐quality evidence). Hospital stay appeared to be lower in the laparoscopic‐endoscopic rendezvous group by about three days (95% CI 3.51 to 2.50 days shorter; 515 participants in five trials; low‐quality evidence). There was very low‐quality evidence that suggested longer operative time with laparoscopic‐endoscopic rendezvous (MD 34.07 minutes, 95% CI 11.41 to 56.74; participants = 313; trials = 3; I² = 93%). The Trial Sequential Analyses of operating time and the length of hospital stay indicated that all the trials crossed the conventional boundaries, suggesting that the sample sizes were adequate, with a low risk of random error. Authors' conclusions There was insufficient evidence to determine the effects of the laparoscopic‐endoscopic rendezvous versus preoperative endoscopic sphincterotomy techniques in people undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy on mortality and morbidity. The laparoscopic‐endoscopic rendezvous procedure may lead to longer operating times, but it may reduce the length of the hospital stay when compared with preoperative endoscopic sphincterotomy followed by laparoscopic cholecystectomy. However, no firm conclusions could be drawn because the quality of evidence was low or very low. If confirmed by future trials, these data might re‐design the scenario of treatment of this condition, albeit requiring greater organisational effort. Future trials should also address issues such as quality of life and cost analysis. Plain language summary Laparoscopic‐endoscopic rendezvous or preoperative endoscopic sphincterotomy before removing the gallbladder for gall stones or bile duct stones Background Only one out of every five to ten people who experiences colicky abdominal pain has stones in the gallbladder or the common bile duct. These biliary stones may lead to cholecystitis (inflammation of the gallbladder), cholangitis (infection of the bile duct), hepatic abscess (abscess in the liver), or acute pancreatitis (infection of the pancreas). There are different techniques used to remove the stones; standard laparotomy (incision in the abdomen), laparoscopic surgery, and endoscopic surgery. Laparoscopic surgery, also called minimally invasive surgery, is a modern surgical technique, in which abdominal operations are performed through long, rigid instruments, inserted through small incisions (usually 0.5 to 1.2 cm) in the abdominal wall. Endoscopy is a more general term, which describes a technique that enables a physician to examine the inside of a hollow organ, by inserting an instrument, generally flexible, through natural body openings. For biliary stones, endoscopy is performed by passing a scope, with a light, through the mouth and down the digestive tract, The physician can see where the biliary tract (liver, bile duct, and pancreas) meets the duodenum (beginning of the small intestine), which makes it easier to pass a tube, through which stones can be removed. The injection of radiologic contrast medium highlights the biliary ducts and their content. This procedure is called endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). A laparotomy is used if laparoscopic surgery is contraindicated. Otherwise, the procedure involves two stages: first, endoscopic removal of stones from the bile duct, followed by laparoscopic cholecystectomy (removal of gallbladder). A combined endoscopic and laparoscopic procedure, called a laparoscopic‐endoscopic rendezvous technique, has been associated with fewer adverse effects, less patient discomfort, and shorter hospital stay. Study characteristics This review compared the benefits and harms of laparoscopic‐endoscopic rendezvous versus preoperative endoscopic sphincterotomy (cutting the muscle between the bile and pancreatic ducts) procedures followed by laparoscopic cholecystectomy to remove stones from the gallbladder and bile duct. By searching scientific databases and trials registers, we found five randomised clinical trials that compared the two approaches, and involved a total of 516 participants. The majority of the participants were females and the age of both men and women ranged from 21 years to 87 years. Funding Only one trial stated they had not received industry sponsorship or other for‐profit support. None of the other trials disclosed information about funding. Three trials stated the investigators had no competing interest; the other two trials did not provide information on competing interests. Key results The laparoscopic‐endoscopic rendezvous approach could be associated with a lower rate of overall morbidity and clinical post‐operative pancreatitis, and a shorter hospital stay. We found no clear differences in overall mortality between the two techniques. Total operative time was longer with the rendezvous approach. We were unable to draw firm conclusions because of the lack of data. Further research is needed to confirm whether the single‐stage approach is safer and more efficacious than the two‐stage approach, and to address other important issues, such as quality of life and cost analysis. Quality of the evidence The quality of the evidence was low or very low, because of small numbers of participants, high risk of bias, and inconsistent and imprecise results across trials. The evidence is current to February 2017.},

abstract = {Abstract - Background Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory bowel disease. Corticosteroids and 5‐aminosalicylates are the most commonly used therapies. However, many patients require immunosuppressive therapy for steroid‐refractory and steroid‐dependent disease. Methotrexate is a medication that is effective for treating a variety of inflammatory diseases, including Crohn's disease. This review was performed to determine the effectiveness of methotrexate treatment in UC patients. This review is an update of a previously published Cochrane review. Objectives To assess the efficacy and safety of methotrexate for induction of remission in patients with UC. Search methods MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL and the Cochrane IBD/FBD group specialized trials register were searched from from inception to June 26, 2014. Study references and review papers were also searched for additional trials. Abstracts from major gastroenterological meetings were searched to identify research published in abstract form only. Selection criteria Randomized controlled trials comparing methotrexate with placebo or an active comparator in patients with active ulcerative colitis were considered for inclusion. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently reviewed studies for eligibility, extracted data and assessed study quality using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. The primary outcome measure was the proportion of patients who achieved clinical remission and withdrawal from steroids as defined by the studies and expressed as a percentage of the total number of patients randomized (intention‐to‐treat analysis). We calculated the risk ratio (RR) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) for dichotomous outcomes. The overall quality of the evidence supporting the primary outcome was assessed using the GRADE criteria. Main results Two studies (n = 101 patients) were included in the review. One study (n = 67) compared oral methotrexate 12.5 mg/week) to placebo. The other study (n = 34) compared oral methotrexate (15 mg/week) to 6‐mercaptopurine (1.5 mg/kg/day) and 5‐aminosalicylic acid (3 g/day). The placebo‐controlled study was judged to be at low risk of bias. The other study was judged to be at high risk of bias due to an open‐label design. There was no statistically significant difference in clinical remission rates between methotrexate and placebo patients. Forty‐seven per cent (14/30) of methotrexate patients achieved clinical remission and complete withdrawal from steroids during the study period compared to 49% (18/37) of placebo patients (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.58 to 1.59. A GRADE analysis indicated that the overall quality of the evidence supporting this outcome was low due to very sparse data (32 events). There were no statistically significant differences in the proportion of patients who achieved clinical remission and withdrawal from steroids in the study comparing oral methotrexate to 6‐mercaptopurine and 5‐aminosalicylic acid. At 30 weeks, 58% (7/12) of methotrexate patients achieved clinical remission and withdrawal from steroids compared to 79% (11/14) of 6‐mercaptopurine patients (RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.43 to 1.29) and 25% of 5‐aminosalicylic acid patients (RR 2.33, 95% CI 0.64 to 8.49). GRADE analyses indicated that the overall quality of the evidence was very low due to very sparse data (18 and 9 events respectively) and and high risk of bias. In the placebo‐controlled trial two patients (7%) were withdrawn from the methotrexate group due to adverse events (leucopenia, migraine) compared to one patient (3%) who had a rash in the placebo group (RR 2.47, 95% CI 0.23 to 25.91). Adverse events experienced by methotrexate patients in the active comparator study included nausea and dyspepsia, mild alopecia, mild increase in aspartate aminotransferase levels, peritoneal abscess, hypoalbuminemia, severe rash and atypical pneumonia. Authors' conclusions Although methotrexate was well‐tolerated, the studies showed no benefit for methotrexate over placebo or active comparators. The results for efficacy outcomes between methotrexate and placebo, methotrexate and 6‐mercaptopurine and methotrexate and 5‐aminosalicylic acid were uncertain. Whether a higher dose or parenteral administration would be effective for induction therapy is unknown. At present there is no evidence supporting the use of methotrexate for induction of remission in active ulcerative colitis. A trial in which larger numbers of patients receive a higher dose of oral methotrexate should be considered. Currently there are two large ongoing placebo‐controlled trials (METEOR and MERIT‐UC) assessing the efficacy and safety of intramuscular or subcutaneous methotrexate in patients with active UC which may help resolve the evidence supporting the use of methotrexate as therapy for active of ulcerative colitis. Plain language summary Methotrexate for treatment of chronic active ulcerative colitis What is ulcerative colitis? Ulcerative colitis is a long‐term (chronic) inflammatory bowel disease characterized by pains (abdominal cramping), a need to rush to the toilet to pass feces (fecal urgency) and bloody diarrhea. What is methotrexate? Methotrexate is a medicine that reduces the body's natural immune responses and may reduce the inflammation associated with ulcerative colitis. When people with ulcerative colitis are experiencing the symptoms of the disease it is said to be ‘active’; periods when the symptoms stop are called ‘remission’. What did the researchers investigate? The researchers investigated whether methotrexate produces remission in people with active ulcerative colitis, and whether it causes any harms (side effects). The researchers searched the medical literature extensively up to June 26, 2014. What did the researchers find? The researchers identified two studies that included a total of 101 participants. One was a high quality study (67 participants) that compared oral methotrexate (12.5 mg/week) to a placebo (a sugar pill or fake medicine). The other study (34 participants) compared oral methotrexate (15 mg/week) against 6‐mercaptopurine (an immunosuppressive drug at a dose of 1.5 mg/kg/day) and against 5‐aminosalicylic acid (an anti‐inflammatory drug at a dose of 3 g/day). In the high quality study, there was no difference between the methotrexate and placebo treatment groups for the number of people who achieved remission and were able to stop taking steroids. This suggests that, when used at this low dose (12.5 mg/week), methotrexate does not produce remission from ulcerative colitis. However, this result is uncertain because of the small number of people who were assessed. The other, smaller study showed no differences between methotrexate and the other treatments in the proportion of participants who experienced remission and were able to stop taking steroids. This result is also uncertain due to poor study design and the low number of participants. The side effects reported in the two studies included leucopenia (a decrease in the number of white blood cells), migraine, rash, nausea and dyspepsia (indigestion), mild alopecia (hair loss), mild increase in levels of an enzyme found in the liver (aspartate aminotransferase), a collection of pus in the abdominal tissue (peritoneal abscess), abnormally low levels of the protein albumin in the blood (hypoalbuminemia), and pneumonia. At present, the results from medical trials do not support the use of low dose oral methotrexate (12.5 mg to 15 mg/week) for the production of remission in active ulcerative colitis. It is not known whether a higher dose of oral methotrexate, or giving methotrexate by a different route (e.g. by injection), would increase the likelihood of remission. In future, researchers should consider organising a study with a larger number of participants who receive a higher dose of oral methotrexate. Currently, there are two large studies being run that compare a higher dose of methotrexate – given by injection – with placebo in people with active ulcerative colitis (the METEOR and MERIT‐UC studies). The results of these studies may resolve the uncertainty surrounding the use of methotrexate for the treatment of active ulcerative colitis.},

abstract = {Abstract - Background Traumatic corneal abrasions are relatively common and there is a lack of consensus about analgesia in their management. It is therefore important to document the clinical efficacy and safety profile of topical ophthalmic non‐steroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in the management of traumatic corneal abrasions. Objectives To identify and evaluate all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing the use of topical NSAIDs with placebo or any alternative analgesic interventions in adults with traumatic corneal abrasions (including corneal abrasions arising from foreign body removal), to reduce pain, and its effects on healing time. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Trials Register) (2017, Issue 2), MEDLINE Ovid (1946 to 30 March 2017), Embase Ovid (1947 to 30 March 2017), LILACS (Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature Database) (1982 to 30 March 2017), OpenGrey (System for Information on Grey Literature in Europe) ( www.opengrey.eu/ ); searched 30 March 2017, ZETOC (1993 to 30 March 2017), the ISRCTN registry ( www.isrctn.com/editAdvancedSearch ); searched 30 March 2017, ClinicalTrials.gov ( www.clinicaltrials.gov ); searched 30 March 2017 and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) ( www.who.int/ictrp/search/en ); searched 30 March 2017. We did not use any date or language restrictions in the electronic searches for trials.We checked the reference lists of identified trials to search for further potentially relevant studies. Selection criteria RCTs comparing topical NSAIDs to placebo or any alternative analgesic interventions in adults with traumatic corneal abrasions. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently performed data extraction and assessed risks of bias in the included studies. We rated the certainty of the evidence using GRADE. Main results We included nine studies that met the inclusion criteria, reporting data on 637 participants.The studies took place in the UK, USA, Israel, Italy, France and Portugal. These studies compared five types of topical NSAIDs (0.1% indomethacin, 0.03% flurbiprofen, 0.5% ketorolac, 1% indomethacin, 0.1% diclofenac) to control (consisting of standard care and in four studies used placebo eye drops). Overall, the studies were at an unclear or high risk of bias (particularly selection and reporting bias). None of the included studies reported the primary outcome measures of this review, namely participant‐reported pain intensity reduction of 30% or more or 50% or more at 24 hours. Four trials, that included data on 481 participants receiving NSAIDs or control (placebo/standard care), reported on the use of ‘rescue’ analgesia at 24 hours as a proxy measure of pain control. Topical NSAIDs were associated with a reduction in the need for oral analgesia compared with control (risk ratio (RR) 0.46, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.34 to 0.61; low‐certainty evidence). Approximately 4 out of 10 people in the control group used rescue analgesia at 24 hours. No data were available on the use of analgesia at 48 or 72 hours. One trial (28 participants) reported on the proportion of abrasions healed after 24 and 48 hours. These outcomes were similar in both arms of the trial. (at 24 hours RR 1.00 (0.81 to 1.23); at 48 hours RR 1.00 (0.88 to 1.14); low‐certainty evidence). In the control group nine out of 10 abrasions were healed within 24 hours and all were healed by 48 hours. Complications of corneal abrasions were reported in 6 studies (609 participants) and were infrequently reported (4 complications, 1 in NSAID groups (recurrent corneal erosion) and 3 in control groups (2 recurrent corneal erosions and 1 corneal abscess), very low‐certainty evidence). Possible drug‐related adverse events (AEs) were reported in two trials (163 participants), with the number of adverse events low (4 AEs, 3 in NSAID group, including discomfort/photophobia on instillation, conjunctival hyperaemia and urticaria, and 1 in the control group, corneal abscess) very low‐certainty evidence. Authors' conclusions The findings of the included studies do not provide strong evidence to support the use of topical NSAIDs in traumatic corneal abrasions. This is important, since NSAIDs are associated with a higher cost compared to oral analgesics. None of the trials addressed our primary outcome measure of participant‐reported pain intensity reduction of 30% or more or 50% or more at 24 hours. Plain language summary Topical non‐steroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for the treatment of pain in traumatic corneal abrasions What is the aim of this review?   The aim of this Cochrane Review was to find out if topical (applied directly to the surface of the eye) non‐steroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for traumatic corneal abrasions reduce pain. Cochrane researchers collected and analysed all relevant studies to answer this question. We found nine studies. Key messages   It is unclear if using topical NSAIDs is helpful in traumatic corneal abrasions. Topical NSAIDs cost more to use than alternative treatments such as oral pain‐killing tablets. What was studied in the review?   A corneal abrasion is a scratch on the cornea of the eye. The cornea is the clear window that is in front of the iris, which is the coloured part of the eye. The cornea is important both for vision and for protecting the eye. When a corneal abrasion occurs, it causes significant pain and discomfort. A traumatic corneal abrasion is a corneal abrasion caused by an injury, such as the eye being poked or something like dirt or sand being trapped under the eyelid and scratching the cornea. NSAIDs are one form of pain management for people with corneal abrasions.They may reduce the pain. What are the main results of the review?   The Cochrane researchers found nine relevant studies. Three studies each were from the UK and the USA, one from Italy, one from Israel and one from France/Portugal. These studies used five types of topical NSAIDs (0.1% indomethacin, 0.03% flurbiprofen, 0.5% ketorolac, 1% indomethacin, 0.1% diclofenac). The studies compared the topical NSAIDs with antibiotic eye drops, artificial tears, eye patching and dummy (placebo) eye drops. Three of the studies were funded by the manufacturer while the other six studies did not report their funding source. The results of the review show that:  ∙ It is unclear if people treated with topical NSAIDs experience a clinically meaningful reduction in pain compared with people being treated with placebo or standard care (antibiotic eye drops, artificial tears, eye patching) but they may use less oral pain killers. ∙ Where drug‐related side effects, and complications of corneal abrasion (e.g. poor healing or infection) were reported (in two trials), the numbers were low. How up‐to‐date is this review?   Cochrane researchers searched for studies that had been published up to March 2017.},

abstract = {Abstract - Background Methotrexate, a folate antagonist, is an immunosuppressant drug that is effective for treating several inflammatory disorders including Crohn's disease. Ulcerative colitis, a related chronic inflammatory bowel disease, can be challenging to treat. T his updated systematic review summarizes the current evidence on the use of methotrexate for induction maintenance of remission in ulcerative colitis. Objectives The objectives of this review were to assess the efficacy and safety of methotrexate for maintenance of remission in patients with ulcerative colitis. Search methods We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL and the Cochrane IBD/FBD group specialized trials register from inception to June 26, 2014. Study references and review papers were also searched for additional trials. Abstracts from major gastroenterological meetings were searched to identify research published in abstract form only. Selection criteria Randomized controlled trials in which methotrexate was compared to placebo or an active comparator in patients with quiescent ulcerative were considered for inclusion. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently extracted data and assessed the risk of bias for each study. The primary outcome was the occurrence of clinical or endoscopic relapse as defined by the primary studies. Secondary outcomes included frequency and nature of adverse events, change of disease activity score and steroid‐sparing effect. We calculated the risk ratio and corresponding 95% confidence interval for dichotomous outcomes. Data were analyzed on an intention‐to‐treat basis. The overall quality of the evidence supporting the outcomes was evaluated using the GRADE criteria. Main results Three trials (165 patients) fulfilled the inclusion criteria. One study compared oral methotrexate (12.5 mg/week) to placebo, another compared oral methotrexate (15 mg/week) to 6‐mercaptopurine (6‐MP, 1.5 mg/kg/day) or 5‐aminosalicylic acid (5‐ASA, 3 g/day) and the other compared methotrexate (15 mg/week) in combination sulfasalazine (3 g/day) to sulfasalazine. The placebo‐controlled study was rated as low risk of bias. The study comparing methotrexate to 6‐MP and 5‐ASA was rated as high risk of bias and the study assessing methotrexate and sulfasalazine was rated as unclear risk of bias for sequence generation, allocation concealment and blinding. The placebo‐controlled study found no statistically significant differences in the proportion of patients who maintained remission. At nine months, 36% (5/14) of methotrexate patients maintained remission compared to 54% (10/18) of placebo patients (RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.28 to 1.45). A GRADE analysis indicated that the overall quality of the evidence for this outcome was low due to very sparse data (15 events). The study comparing combination therapy to sulfasalazine found no statistically significant difference in the proportion of patients who maintained remission. At 12 months, 100% (14/14) of patients in the combination group maintained remission compared to 75% (9/12) of sulfasalazine patients (RR 1.32, 95% CI 0.94 to 0.86), A GRADE analysis indicated that the overall quality of the evidence for this outcome was very low due to unknown risk of bias and very sparse data (23 events). There were no statistically significant differences in maintenance of remission rates between methotrexate and 6‐MP or between methotrexate and 5‐ASA. At 76 weeks, 14% (1/7) of methotrexate patients maintained remission compared to 64% (7/11) of 6‐MP patients (RR 0.22, 95% CI 0.03 to 1.45) and 0% (0/2) of 5‐ASA patients (RR 1.13, 95% CI 0.06 to 20.71). A GRADE analysis indicated that the overall quality of the evidence from this study was very low due to high risk of bias and very sparse data. Adverse events reported in these studies included transient leucopenia, migraine, nausea and dyspepsia, mild alopecia, mild increase in aspartate aminotransferase levels, peritoneal abscess, hypoalbuminemia, severe rash and atypical pneumonia Authors' conclusions The results for efficacy and safety outcomes between methotrexate and placebo, methotrexate and sulfasalazine, methotrexate and 6‐mercaptopurine and methotrexate and 5‐aminosalicylic acid were uncertain. Whether a higher dose or parenteral administration of methotrexate would be effective in quiescent ulcerative colitis is unknown. At present there is no evidence supporting the use of methotrexate for maintenance of remission in ulcerative colitis. More studies are needed to determine the efficacy and safety of methotrexate maintenance therapy in patients with quiescent ulcerative colitis. Large scale methodologically rigorous randomized controlled trials are needed. These studies should investigate higher doses of methotrexate (e.g. 15 to 25 mg/week) and parenteral administration. Plain language summary Methotrexate for keeping ulcerative colitis inactive    Review Question We reviewed the evidence about the effects and safety of methotrexate for maintaining remission in patients with ulcerative colitis, with the medical literature up to June 26, 2014. Background What is ulcerative colitis? Ulcerative colitis is a chronic inflammatory bowel disease characterized by recurrent episodes of active disease, which commonly affect the rectum or colon or both. Patients with active disease may experience abdominal cramping, urgency to pass stools, and bloody diarrhea. When the symptoms stop, patients are considered to be in remission. What is methotrexate? Methotrexate is a medication that reduces the body's immune responses and may reduce inflammation associated with ulcerative colitis. Study Characteristics The researchers identified three studies that included a total of 165 patients. One study (67 patients) compared oral methotrexate (12.5 mg/week) to placebo (e.g. a sugar pill or fake medicine), one study (26 patients) compared oral methotrexate (15 mg/week) and sulfasalazine (3 g/day) to sulfasalazine alone, and one study (72 patients in total; of which, 34 had ulcerative colitis ) compared oral methotrexate (15 mg/week) to 6‐mercaptopurine (1.5 mg/kg/day) or 5‐aminosalicylic acid (3 g/day). Two studies were judged to be of very low quality and the placebo‐controlled study was judged to be of high quality. Key Results There was no difference between the methotrexate and placebo treatment groups for the number of people who maintained remission at nine months. This suggests that, when used at this low dose (12.5 mg/week) methotrexate does not maintain remission in patients with inactive ulcerative colitis. However, this result is uncertain due to the small number of people who were assessed There was no difference between the combination therapy (methotrexate plus sulfasalazine) and sulfasalazine treatment groups for the number of people who maintained remission at 12 months. This result is uncertain due to poor study design and the low number of participants. The other, small study showed no differences between methotrexate and the other treatments (6‐mercaptopurine and 5‐aminosalicylic acid) in the proportion of participants who were able to maintain remission. These results are uncertain due to poor study design and the low number of participants. The side effects reported in the studies included leucopenia (a decrease in the number of white blood cells), migraine, rash, nausea and dyspepsia (indigestion), mild alopecia (hair loss), mild increase in levels of an enzyme found in the liver (aspartate aminotransferase), a collection of pus in the abdominal tissue (peritoneal abscess), abnormally low levels of the protein albumin in the blood (hypoalbuminemia), and pneumonia. At present, the results from medical trials do not support the use of low dose oral methotrexate (12.5 mg to 15 mg/week) for maintenance of remission in people with inactive ulcerative colitis. It is not known whether a higher dose of oral methotrexate, or giving methotrexate by a different route (e.g. by injection), would be effective for maintenance of remission in people with inactive ulcerative colitis. In future, researchers should consider organizing a study with a larger number of participants who receive a higher dose of methotrexate (15 to 25 mg/week). Future studies should also investigate methotrexate given by injection. The results of such studies may resolve the uncertainty surrounding the use of methotrexate as maintenance therapy in people with inactive ulcerative colitis.},

abstract = {Abstract - Background Acute rhinosinusitis is an acute infection of the nasal passages and paranasal sinuses that lasts less than four weeks. Diagnosis of acute rhinosinusitis is generally based on clinical signs and symptoms in ambulatory care settings. Technical investigations are not routinely performed, nor are they recommended in most countries. Some trials show a trend in favour of antibiotics, but the balance of benefit versus harm is unclear. We merged two Cochrane Reviews for this update, which comprised different approaches with overlapping populations, resulting in different conclusions. For this review update, we maintained the distinction between populations diagnosed by clinical signs and symptoms, or imaging. Objectives To assess the effects of antibiotics versus placebo or no treatment in adults with acute rhinosinusitis in ambulatory care settings. Search methods We searched CENTRAL (2017, Issue 12), which contains the Cochrane Acute Respiratory Infections Group's Specialised Register, MEDLINE (January 1950 to January 2018), Embase (January 1974 to January 2018), and two trials registers (January 2018). We also checked references from identified trials, systematic reviews, and relevant guidelines. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials of antibiotics versus placebo or no treatment in people with rhinosinusitis‐like signs or symptoms or sinusitis confirmed by imaging. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently extracted data about cure and side effects and assessed the risk of bias. We contacted trial authors for additional information as required. Main results We included 15 trials involving 3057 participants. Of the 15 included trials, 10 appeared in our 2012 review, and five (631 participants) are legacy trials from merging two reviews. No new studies were included from searches for this update. Overall, risk of bias was low. Without antibiotics, 46% of participants with rhinosinusitis, whether or not confirmed by radiography, were cured after 1 week and 64% after 14 days. Antibiotics can shorten time to cure, but only 5 to 11 more people per 100 will be cured faster if they receive antibiotics instead of placebo or no treatment: clinical diagnosis (odds ratio (OR) 1.25, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.02 to 1.54; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) 19, 95% CI 10 to 205; I² = 0%; 8 trials; high‐quality evidence) and diagnosis confirmed by radiography (OR 1.57, 95% CI 1.03 to 2.39; NNTB 10, 95% CI 5 to 136; I² = 0%; 3 trials; moderate‐quality evidence). Cure rates with antibiotics were higher when a fluid level or total opacification in any sinus was found on computed tomography (OR 4.89, 95% CI 1.75 to 13.72; NNTB 4, 95% CI 2 to 15; 1 trial; moderate‐quality evidence). Purulent secretion resolved faster with antibiotics (OR 1.58, 95% CI 1.13 to 2.22; NNTB 10, 95% CI 6 to 35; I² = 0%; 3 trials; high‐quality evidence). However, 13 more people experienced side effects with antibiotics compared to placebo or no treatment (OR 2.21, 95% CI 1.74 to 2.82; number needed to treat for an additional harmful outcome (NNTH) 8, 95% CI 6 to 12; I² = 16%; 10 trials; high‐quality evidence). Five fewer people per 100 will experience clinical failure if they receive antibiotics instead of placebo or no treatment (Peto OR 0.48, 95% CI 0.36 to 0.63; NNTH 19, 95% CI 15 to 27; I² = 21%; 12 trials; high‐quality evidence). A disease‐related complication (brain abscess) occurred in one participant (of 3057) one week after receiving open antibiotic therapy (clinical failure, control group). Authors' conclusions The potential benefit of antibiotics to treat acute rhinosinusitis diagnosed either clinically (low risk of bias, high‐quality evidence) or confirmed by imaging (low to unclear risk of bias, moderate‐quality evidence) is marginal and needs to be seen in the context of the risk of adverse effects. Considering antibiotic resistance, and the very low incidence of serious complications, we conclude there is no place for antibiotics for people with uncomplicated acute rhinosinusitis. We could not draw conclusions about children, people with suppressed immune systems, and those with severe sinusitis, because these populations were not included in the available trials. Plain language summary Antibiotics for sinus infection of short duration in adults Review question Do antibiotics cure sinus infection faster than no antibiotics in adults? Background A sinus is a cavity situated in the head. Adults with short‐duration sinus infection experience stuffy nose and thick, yellow discharge from the nose. People with sinus infection can feel slime in the back of the throat, facial pain, pain when bending forward, and pain in the upper teeth or when chewing. A short‐duration sinus infection may be suspected following physical examination and questions about symptoms. Blood examination or images of the sinuses can support diagnosis, but are not routinely recommended in most countries. Short‐duration sinus infections are mostly caused by viruses. Nevertheless, physicians tend to prescribe antibiotics, which should only be used to treat bacterial infections. Taking antibiotics unnecessarily results in antibiotic resistance against bacterial infections. We investigated whether antibiotics cure adults with short‐duration sinus infection faster than a dummy drug (placebo) or no treatment. Search date 18 January 2018. Study characteristics We included 15 studies in which adults with short‐duration sinus infection, whether or not confirmed by imaging, randomly received antibiotics, or a dummy drug or no treatment, in ambulatory care settings. The studies included a total of 3057 adults whose average age was 36 years; about 60% were female. Participants were followed until they were cured. Trial duration ranged from 8 to 28 days. Study funding sources Seven studies received financial support from government or academic institutions; six received grants from the pharmaceutical industry; and five did not state sources of support. Key results Without antibiotics, almost half of all participants were cured after one week, and two out of three were cured after 14 days. Five (diagnosis based on symptoms described to a doctor) to 11 (diagnosis confirmed by x‐ray) more people per 100 were cured faster with antibiotics. A computed tomography (CT) scan could better predict who would benefit from antibiotics, but routine use would cause health problems related to radiation exposure. Ten more people per 100 were relieved faster of thick, yellow discharge from the nose with antibiotics compared to a dummy drug or no treatment. Thirteen more people per 100 experienced side effects (mostly concerning stomach or intestines) with antibiotics compared to a dummy drug or no treatment. Compared with people who initially started antibiotics, five more people per 100 in the dummy drug or no treatment group had to start antibiotics because their condition worsened. Serious complications (e.g. brain abscess) were rare. We found that antibiotics are not a first‐choice treatment for adults with short‐duration sinus infection. We found no evidence relating to adults with severe sinusitis or with reduced immunity, or to children. Quality of evidence We found high‐quality evidence when the diagnosis was based on symptoms described to a doctor. We downgraded evidence quality to moderate when diagnosis was confirmed by x‐ray or CT scan because the number of participants was small, which makes the estimates less reliable.},

abstract = {Abstract - Background Diverticular disease is a common condition in Western industrialised countries. Most individuals remain asymptomatic throughout life; however, 25% experience acute diverticulitis. The standard treatment for acute diverticulitis is open surgery. Laparoscopic surgery ‐ a minimal‐access procedure ‐ offers an alternative approach to open surgery, as it is characterised by reduced operative stress that may translate into shorter hospitalisation and more rapid recovery, as well as improved quality of life. Objectives To evaluate the effectiveness of laparoscopic surgical resection compared with open surgical resection for individuals with acute sigmoid diverticulitis. Search methods We searched the following electronic databases: the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2017, Issue 2) in the Cochrane Library; Ovid MEDLINE (1946 to 23 February 2017); Ovid Embase (1974 to 23 February 2017); clinicaltrials.gov (February 2017); and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry (February 2017). We reviewed the bibliographies of identified trials to search for additional studies. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials comparing elective or emergency laparoscopic sigmoid resection versus open surgical resection for acute sigmoid diverticulitis. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently selected studies, assessed the domains of risk of bias from each included trial, and extracted data. For dichotomous outcomes, we calculated risk ratios (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). For continuous outcomes, we planned to calculate mean differences (MDs) with 95% CIs for outcomes such as hospital stay, and standardised mean differences (SMDs) with 95% CIs for quality of life and global rating scales, if researchers used different scales. Main results Three trials with 392 participants met the inclusion criteria. Studies were conducted in three European countries (Switzerland, Netherlands, and Germany). The median age of participants ranged from 62 to 66 years; 53% to 64% were female. Inclusion criteria differed among studies. One trial included participants with Hinchey I characteristics as well as those who underwent Hartmann’s procedure; the second trial included only participants with "a proven stage II/III disease according to the classification of Stock and Hansen"; the third trial considered for inclusion patients with "diverticular disease of sigmoid colon documented by colonoscopy and 2 episodes of uncomplicated diverticulitis, one at least being documented with CT scan, 1 episode of complicated diverticulitis, with a pericolic abscess (Hinchey stage I) or pelvic abscess (Hinchey stage II) requiring percutaneous drainage." We determined that two studies were at low risk of selection bias; two that reported considerable dropouts were at high risk of attrition bias; none reported blinding of outcome assessors (unclear detection bias); and all were exposed to performance bias owing to the nature of the intervention. Available low‐quality evidence suggests that laparoscopic surgical resection may lead to little or no difference in mean hospital stay compared with open surgical resection (3 studies, 360 participants; MD ‐0.62 (days), 95% CI ‐2.49 to 1.25; I² = 0%). Low‐quality evidence suggests that operating time was longer in the laparoscopic surgery group than in the open surgery group (3 studies, 360 participants; MD 49.28 (minutes), 95% CI 40.64 to 57.93; I² = 0%). We are uncertain whether laparoscopic surgery improves postoperative pain between day 1 and day 3 more effectively than open surgery. Low‐quality evidence suggests that laparoscopic surgery may improve postoperative pain at the fourth postoperative day more effectively than open surgery (2 studies, 250 participants; MD = ‐0.65, 95% CI ‐1.04 to ‐0.25). Researchers reported quality of life differently across trials, hindering the possibility of meta‐analysis. Low‐quality evidence from one trial using the Short Form (SF)‐36 questionnaire six weeks after surgery suggests that laparoscopic intervention may improve quality of life, whereas evidence from two other trials using the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer core quality of life questionnaire (EORTC QLQ‐C30) v3 and the Gastrointestinal Quality of Life Index score, respectively, suggests that laparoscopic surgery may make little or no difference in improving quality of life compared with open surgery. We are uncertain whether laparoscopic surgery improves the following outcomes: 30‐day postoperative mortality, early overall morbidity, major and minor complications, surgical complications, postoperative times to liquid and solid diets, and reoperations due to anastomotic leak. Authors' conclusions Results from the present comprehensive review indicate that evidence to support or refute the safety and effectiveness of laparoscopic surgery versus open surgical resection for treatment of patients with acute diverticular disease is insufficient. Well‐designed trials with adequate sample size are needed to investigate the efficacy of laparoscopic surgery towards important patient‐oriented (e.g. postoperative pain) and health system‐oriented outcomes (e.g. mean hospital stay). Plain language summary Laparoscopic surgery versus open surgery for acute sigmoid diverticulitis Background Diverticular disease is a condition in which the inner layer of the intestinal wall (mucosa) protrudes through weak points in the muscular layer of the wall, forming small pouches (diverticula) that bulge out of the large bowel. The inflammation of diverticula is defined as diverticulitis. Diverticulitis is more common in the sigmoid colon than in the other tracts of the large bowel. In Western countries, diverticular disease is very common, affecting about 60% of the population over 70 years of age. Most individuals with diverticular disease have no symptoms or experience only mild pain in the lower abdomen, accompanied by a slight change in bowel habits. Individuals with acute diverticulitis may experience pain in the lower abdomen and other symptoms such as fever, nausea, vomiting, and shivering. Diverticulitis generally is treated medically with antibiotics and diet. However, for individuals who experience recurrent abdominal pain or complications, surgical resection of the affected bowel segment is required; this can be performed through conventional open or laparoscopic surgery techniques. In open surgery, a large abdominal incision is made at the midline to gain access to the abdominal cavity, but via laparoscopy, only small parietal incisions (usually 5 to 12 mm long) are made through the abdominal wall, allowing positioning of gas laparoscopic parietal cannulas (tubes that are inserted into the body) that provide access to the abdominal cavity with long‐handled dedicated surgical instruments used under vision of an endoscopic camera. A laparoscopic parietal cannula is a sharp‐pointed surgical instrument that is fitted with a tight cannula and is used to insert the tight cannula into a body cavity. This review addresses the question of whether laparoscopy is more effective and/or safer than open surgery in the treatment of individuals with diverticulitis of the sigmoid colon who require a surgical resection. Study characteristics We identified three trials that compared the efficacy of laparoscopic surgery and open surgery. These studies included 392 participants (195 in the laparoscopic group vs 197 in the open surgery group). The method used to allocate participants based on randomisation, that is, the choice of treatment that participants received, was determined by a method similar to coin tossing, so the two groups were as similar as possible. Key findings We found that laparoscopic surgical resection may lead to little or no difference in mean hospital stay when compared with open surgical resection. Operating time was longer in the laparoscopic group by an average of 49 minutes. No important differences were observed in terms of 30‐day postoperative mortality, early overall morbidity, major and minor complications, surgical complications, postoperative times to liquid and solid diets, and reoperations due to anastomotic leak. To assess quality of life, researchers used different scales at different periods of time. Although one trial reported that patients who received laparoscopic surgery had better quality of life, the other two trials showed no benefit favouring either laparoscopic surgery or open surgery. Quality of the evidence The quality of the evidence varied from low to very low owing to risk of bias (i.e. conclusions may overestimate benefits or underestimate harms because of biased study design and conduct) and limitations in the patient population sample. Well‐designed trials are necessary to obtain a more accurate estimate of the benefits and safety of laparoscopic surgery over open surgery.},

ISSN = {1465-1858},
abstract = {Abstract - Background Crowns for primary molars are preformed and come in a variety of sizes and materials to be placed over decayed or developmentally defective teeth. They can be made completely of stainless steel (know as 'preformed metal crowns' or PMCs), or to give better aesthetics, may be made of stainless steel with a white veneer cover or made wholly of a white ceramic material. In most cases, teeth are trimmed for the crowns to be fitted conventionally using a local anaesthetic. However, in the case of the Hall Technique, PMCs are pushed over the tooth with no local anaesthetic, carious tissue removal or tooth preparation. Crowns are recommended for restoring primary molar teeth that have had a pulp treatment, are very decayed or are badly broken down. However, few dental practitioners use them in clinical practice. This review updates the original review published in 2007. Objectives Primary objective To evaluate the clinical effectiveness and safety of all types of preformed crowns for restoring primary teeth compared with conventional filling materials (such as amalgam, composite, glass ionomer, resin modified glass ionomer and compomers), other types of crowns or methods of crown placement, non‐restorative caries treatment or no treatment. Secondary objective To explore whether the extent of decay has an effect on the clinical outcome of primary teeth restored with all types of preformed crowns compared with those restored with conventional filling materials. Search methods We searched the following electronic databases: Cochrane Oral Health Group Trials Register (to 21 January 2015), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL;  The Cochrane Library,  2014, Issue 12), MEDLINE via Ovid (1946 to 21 January 2015) and EMBASE via Ovid (1980 to 21 January 2015). We searched the US National Institutes of Health Trials Register ( http://clinicaltrials.gov ) and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform for ongoing trials and Open Grey for grey literature (to 21 January 2015). No restrictions were placed on the language or date of publication when searching the databases. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that assessed the effectiveness of crowns compared with fillings, other types of crowns, non‐restorative approaches or no treatment in children with untreated tooth decay in one or more primary molar teeth. We would also have included trials comparing different methods of fitting crowns. For trials to be considered for this review, the success or failure of the interventions and other clinical outcomes had to be reported at least six months after intervention (with the exception of 'pain/discomfort during treatment and immediately postoperatively'). Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently assessed the title and abstracts for each article from the search results. and independently assessed the full text for each potentially relevant study. At least two authors assessed risk of bias and extracted data using a piloted data extraction form. Main results We included five studies that evaluated three comparisons. Four studies compared crowns with fillings; two of them compared conventional PMCs with open sandwich restorations, and two compared PMCs fitted using the Hall Technique with fillings. One of these studies included a third arm, which allowed the comparison of PMCs (fitted using the Hall Technique) versus non‐restorative caries treatment. In the two studies using crowns fitted using the conventional method, all teeth had undergone pulpotomy prior to the crown being placed. The final study compared two different types of crowns: PMCs versus aesthetic stainless steel crowns with white veneers. No RCT evidence was found that compared different methods of fitting preformed metal crowns (i.e. Hall Technique versus conventional technique). We considered outcomes reported at the dental appointment or within 24 hours of it, and in the short term (less than 12 months) or long term (12 months or more). Some of our outcomes of interest were not measured in the studies: time to restoration failure or retreatment, patient satisfaction and costs. Crowns versus fillings All studies in this comparison used PMCs. One study reported outcomes in the short term and found no reports of major failure or pain in either group. There was moderate quality evidence that the risk of major failure was lower in the crowns group in the long term (risk ratio (RR) 0.18, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.06 to 0.56; 346 teeth in three studies, one conventional and two using Hall Technique). Similarly, there was moderate quality evidence that the risk of pain was lower in the long term for the crown group (RR 0.15, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.67; 312 teeth in two studies). Discomfort associated with the procedure was lower for crowns fitted using the Hall Technique than for fillings (RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.36 to 0.87; 381 teeth) (moderate quality evidence). It is uncertain whether there is a clinically important difference in the risk of gingival bleeding when using crowns rather than fillings, either in the short term (RR 1.69, 95% CI 0.61 to 4.66; 226 teeth) or long term (RR 1.74, 95% CI 0.99 to 3.06; 195 teeth, two studies using PMCs with conventional technique at 12 months) (low quality evidence). Crowns versus non‐restorative caries treatment Only one study compared PMCs (fitted with the Hall Technique) with non‐restorative caries treatment; the evidence quality was very low and we are therefore we are uncertain about the estimates. Metal crowns versus aesthetic crowns One split‐mouth study (11 participants) compared PMCs versus aesthetic crowns (stainless steel with white veneers). It provided very low quality evidence so no conclusions could be drawn. Authors' conclusions Crowns placed on primary molar teeth with carious lesions, or following pulp treatment, are likely to reduce the risk of major failure or pain in the long term compared to fillings. Crowns fitted using the Hall Technique may reduce discomfort at the time of treatment compared to fillings. The amount and quality of evidence for crowns compared to non‐restorative caries, and for metal compared with aesthetic crowns, is very low. There are no RCTs comparing crowns fitted conventionally versus using the Hall Technique. Plain language summary Preformed crowns for managing decayed primary molar teeth in children Background To stop further damage and restore function of primary molar teeth that are decayed or malformed, a dentist will usually use a filling (a soft material that is placed in the cavity and hardened) to restore the tooth to its original shape. Alternatively the dentist may place a crown over the tooth to cover it. This usually requires an injection in the gum to numb the tooth before trimming it down (conventional technique). These crowns are pre‐made (i.e. preformed) in a variety of sizes and can be metal or white, with the correct size being chosen to fit the trimmed down tooth. The Hall Technique is an alternative method for fitting metal crowns, where there is no need for an injection or tooth trimming as the crown is simply pushed over the tooth. Preformed crowns are recommended by specialists in children's dentistry for the management of baby back teeth (molars) when they are affected by moderate to advanced tooth decay, or where the enamel has malformed during development or the tooth has had to have root canal treatment. Review question This Cochrane review asked whether crowns are better than other ways of managing decay in children's baby teeth for reducing 'major failure' (an outcome that includes aspects such as toothache and dental abscess), pain during treatment and harm, and for improving satisfaction with treatment. It also asked whether metal or white crowns were better and whether a new fitting method called the Hall Technique was better than the conventional fitting technique. The review updates one originally published in 2007. Study characteristics We searched medical and dental sources for studies up to 21 January 2015. We identified five relevant studies. They were at high risk of bias because the participants knew which treatment they received and so did the people who treated them. Four studies compared crowns with fillings. Two of them compared metal crowns fitted using the conventional method with fillings and two compared metal crowns fitted using the Hall Technique with fillings. One of the studies also compared the Hall Technique with 'non‐restorative caries treatment' (not using either a filling or crown but opening the cavity to make it possible to clean with a toothbrush, sealing with fluoride varnish and encouraging toothbrushing). The final study compared crowns made of two different materials (stainless steel versus stainless steel with a white covering). We looked at what happened for each treatment at the time of the dental appointment or within 24 hours of treatment, in the short term (less than 12 months) and long term (12 months to 48 months). Key results Teeth restored with preformed crowns are less likely to develop problems (e.g. abscess) or cause pain in the long term, compared to fillings. Crowns fitted using the Hall Technique (no injections or tooth trimming) gave less discomfort at the time of the appointment, when compared with fillings. Crowns may increase the risk of gingival bleeding but this result was unclear. Only one small study compared crowns with non‐restorative caries treatment and one small study compared metal and white crowns, and we could draw no reliable conclusions from these. Some of our outcomes of interest were not measured in any of the studies: these included time to restoration failure or retreatment, patient satisfaction and costs. Quality of the evidence There is moderate quality evidence that crowns are more effective than fillings for managing decay in primary molar teeth. There is moderate quality evidence that crowns fitted using the Hall Technique are less likely to cause abscesses and pain than fillings. The evidence comparing preformed crowns with non‐restorative caries management, and comparing preformed metal crowns with preformed white crowns, is very low quality so we do not know which is better. Author's conclusion Crowns placed on primary molar teeth with decay, or that have had pulp treatment, are likely to reduce the risk of major failure or pain in the long term compared to fillings. Crowns fitted using the Hall Technique may reduce discomfort at the time of treatment compared to fillings.},

abstract = {Abstract - Background Crohn's disease (CD) is a chronic inflammatory bowel disease that most commonly involves the terminal ileum and colon (55 percent). Surgical treatment is required in approximately 70 percent of patients. Multiple procedures and repeat operations are required in 30 ‐ 70 percent of all patients ( Duepree 2002 ) but the disease remains incurable. Laparoscopy has gained wide acceptance in gastrointestinal surgery with potential advantages of faster return to normal activity and diet, reduced hospital stay, reduced postoperative pain, better cosmesis ( Duepree 2002 ,  Dunker 1998 ,  Milsom 2001 ,  Reissman 1996 ), improved social and sexual interaction ( Albaz 2000 ) and its use is accepted in benign and malignant colorectal diseases. Laparoscopic surgery offers additional advantage of smaller abdominal fascial wounds, low incidence of hernias, and decreased rate of adhesive small‐bowel obstruction ( Albaz 2000 ) compared with conventional surgery reducing the need for non‐disease‐related surgical procedures in CD population. There are concerns about missing occult segments of disease and critical proximal strictures due to limited tactile ability, earlier recurrence due to possible reduced immune response induced by laparoscopy, technical difficulty due to fragile inflamed bowel and mesentery and the existence of adhesions, fistulas, and abscesses ( Uchikoshi 2004 ). It is therefore important to evaluate the potential benefits and risks of laparoscopic surgery versus open surgery in patients with small bowel CD ( Lowney 2005 ). Objectives To determine if there is a difference in the perioperative outcomes and re‐operation rates for disease recurrence following laparoscopic surgery compared to open surgery in small bowel CD. Search methods Published and unpublished randomised controlled trials were searched for in the following electronic databases:   The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) 2010 issue 2   The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE) 2010 issue 2   The Cochrane Colorectal Cancer Group Controlled Trials Register   Ovid MEDLINE (1990 to 2010)   EMBASE (1990 to 2010)   Health Technology Assessment (HTA) Database (1990 to 2010) Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCT) comparing laparoscopic and open surgery for small bowel CD were included. Data collection and analysis Two reviewers independently assessed the studies and extracted data. RevMan 5.0 was used for statistical analysis. Main results Two RCTs comparing laparoscopic and open surgery for small bowel CD were identified. Long term outcomes of the patients in both the trials were published separately and these were included in the review. Laparoscopic surgery appeared to be associated with reduced number of wound infections (1/61 vs 9/59), reoperation rates for non disease related complications (3/57 vs 7/54 ) but the difference was not statistically significant [p values were 0.23 and 0.19 respectively]. There was no statistically significant difference between any of the compared outcomes between laparoscopic and open surgery in the management of small bowel CD. Authors' conclusions Laparoscopic surgery for small bowel CD may be as safe as the open operation. There was no significant difference in the perioperative outcomes and the long term reoperation rates for disease‐related or non‐disease related complications of CD. Plain language summary Comparision of key hole surgery and conventional surgery in the management of small bowel Crohn's disease. This review finds that laparoscopic surgery for small bowel Crohn's disease may be as safe as conventional surgery. There is no significant difference in the perioperative outcomes and long‐term disease recurrence rates. However, there are only two RCTs (including 120 patients) so far and no reliable conclusions can be made regarding the benefits of laparoscopic surgery.},

abstract = {Abstract - Background Penetrating abdominal trauma occurs when the peritoneal cavity is breached. Routine laparotomy for penetrating abdominal injuries began in the 1800s, with antibiotics first being used in World War II to combat septic complications associated with these injuries. This practice was marked with a reduction in sepsis‐related mortality and morbidity. Whether prophylactic antibiotics are required in the prevention of infective complications following penetrating abdominal trauma is controversial, however, as no randomised placebo controlled trials have been published to date. There has also been debate about the timing of antibiotic prophylaxis. In 1972 Fullen noted a 7% to 11% post‐surgical infection rate with pre‐operative antibiotics, a 33% to 57% infection rate with intra‐operative antibiotic administration and 30% to 70% infection rate with only post‐operative antibiotic administration. Current guidelines state there is sufficient class I evidence to support the use of a single pre‐operative broad spectrum antibiotic dose, with aerobic and anaerobic cover, and continuation (up to 24 hours) only in the event of a hollow viscus perforation found at exploratory laparotomy. Objectives To assess the benefits and harms of prophylactic antibiotics administered for penetrating abdominal injuries for the reduction of the incidence of septic complications, such as septicaemia, intra‐abdominal abscesses and wound infections. Search methods Searches were not restricted by date, language or publication status. We searched the following electronic databases: the Cochrane Injuries Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library 2013, issue 12 of 12), MEDLINE (OvidSP), Embase (OvidSP), ISI Web of Science: Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI‐EXPANDED), ISI Web of Science: Conference Proceedings Citation Index‐ Science (CPCI‐S) and PubMed. Searches were last conducted in January 2013. Selection criteria All randomised controlled trials of antibiotic prophylaxis in patients with penetrating abdominal trauma versus no antibiotics or placebo. Data collection and analysis Two authors screened the literature search results independently. Main results We identified no trials meeting the inclusion criteria. Authors' conclusions There is currently no information from randomised controlled trials to support or refute the use of antibiotics for patients with penetrating abdominal trauma. Plain language summary Should prophylactic antibiotics be used in patients with penetrating abdominal trauma? For over half a century antibiotics have been given to patients that have suffered from a penetrating injury to the abdominal peritoneal cavity in an attempt to decrease the incidence of post‐operative wound infection, intra‐abdominal infection and mortality. This review was designed to assess whether or not this practice is supported by medical evidence. No randomised controlled trials could be found that met the inclusion criteria for this review. Therefore, there is no evidence to unequivocally support or refute this practice. Current guidelines are based on expert opinion rather than fact. We recommend that a randomised controlled trial be designed to assess which patients would benefit from antibiotic prophylaxis, and which patients would not. Hopefully this would result in less unnecessary antibiotic use, and thus less antibiotic resistance.},

abstract = {Abstract - Background Diverticulitis is an inflammatory complication to the very common condition diverticulosis. Uncomplicated diverticulitis has traditionally been treated with antibiotics with reference to the microbiology, extrapolation from trials on complicated intra‐abdominal infections and clinical experience. Objectives To assess the effects of antibiotic interventions for uncomplicated diverticulitis on relevant outcome. Search methods Studies were identified by computerised searches of the  The Cochrane Library  (CENTRAL), MEDLINE and EMBASE. Ongoing trials were identified and reference lists of identified trials and relevant review articles were screened for additional studies. Selection criteria RCTs including all types of patients with a radiological confirmed diagnosis of left‐sided uncomplicated diverticulitis. Interventions of antibiotics compared to any other antibiotic treatment (different regime, route of administration, dosage or duration of treatment), placebo or no antibiotics. Outcome measures were complications, emergency surgery, recurrence, late complications and duration of hospital stay and recovery of signs of infection. Data collection and analysis Two authors performed the searches, identification of RCTs, trial assessment and data extraction. Disagreements were resolved by discussion or involvement of a third part. Authors of trials were contacted to obtain additional data if needed or were contacted for preliminary results of ongoing trials. Effect estimates were extracted as relative risks (RR). Main results Three RCTs were identified. A qualitative approach with no meta analysis was performed because of variety in interventions between included studies. Interventions compared were antibiotics to no antibiotics, single to double compound antibiotic therapy and short to long IV administration. None of the studies found significant difference between the tested interventions. Risk of bias varied from low to high. The newest RCT overall had the best quality and statistical power. Authors' conclusions The newest evidence from one RCT says there is no significant difference between antibiotics versus no antibiotics in the treatment of uncomplicated diverticulitis. Previous RCTs have only suggested a non‐inferiority between different antibiotic regimes and treatment lengths. This new evidence needs confirmation from more RCTs before it can be implicated safely in clinical guidelines. Ongoing RCTs will be published in the years to come and more are needed. The role of antibiotics in the treatment of complicated diverticulitis has not been investigated yet. Plain language summary Antibiotics for uncomplicated diverticulitis Diverticulitis is a condition with inflammation of big bowel herniations termed diverticulae. Diverticulae are common in the elderly above age 70 and usually do not cause symptoms. However, in some cases inflammation cause a condition, diverticulitis, with pain in the abdomen and signs of infection like fever. Diverticulitis causes no complications in most cases, however, some develop complications and need surgery. The uncomplicated diverticulitis is the focus of this review. It has traditionally been viewed as an infection with bacterial overgrowth in the big bowel and has therefore been treated with antibiotics. We aimed to investigate if there existed any clinical research, evidence, on the effects of antibiotics for uncomplicated diverticulitis in this review. We found 3 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on the use of antibiotics for uncomplicated diverticulitis tested on hospitalised patients. The newest trial investigating the actual need for antibiotics when compared to no antibiotics, a second investigated two different antibiotic cures and a third investigated the length of IV antibiotic treatment. None of the studies found a statistical difference in the tested antibiotic regimes. The newest trial had the overall best quality and had the biggest groups of patients making it the overall best trial. It found no difference in the occurrence of surgery needing complications like abscesses and perforations of the big bowel. Antibiotics can cause serious adverse events for patients like allergic reactions and can even cause other life threatening infections of the bowel. Ultimately, there is a growing antibiotic resistance meaning that the drugs loose their ability to function as bactericidals. This causes limitations in the clinical use of antibiotics when they are needed for treating patients with infections. Therefore there exists strong arguments for limiting the use of antibiotics. The trial that showed no effect of antibiotics is very new and needs confirmation from other similar trials. Ongoing trials will in the next few years be published on the subject.},

abstract = {Abstract - Background Skin and soft‐tissue infections (SSTIs) are common infections of the epidermis, dermis or subcutaneous tissue. SSTIs range in severity from minor, self‐limiting, superficial infections to deep, aggressive, gangrenous, life‐threatening infections. Some classifications divide SSTIs into 'complicated' and 'uncomplicated' infections based on clinical severity. Treatments of SSTIs involves antibiotic therapy, surgical debridement or drainage, and resuscitation if required. Sometimes these treatments are limited by high treatment costs, bacterial resistance to antibiotics and side effects, therefore, many people with SSTIs are turning to Chinese herbal medicines to treat this problem. Chinese herbal medicines are natural substances that have been used for centuries in China where they are generally considered to be effective for SSTIs. Some Chinese herbal medicines have been shown to have antibacterial and anti‐inflammatory properties, although a few herbal medicines have been reported to have side effects. Therefore there is a need to review the current clinical evidence systematically to inform current practice and guide future studies on Chinese herbal medicines for SSTIs. Objectives To evaluate the benefits and harms of Chinese herbal medicines for treating skin and soft‐tissue infections (SSTIs). Search methods Searches were not restricted by date, language or publication status. In July 2014 we searched the following electronic databases: the Cochrane Wounds Group Specialised Register; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) ( The Cochrane Library ); Ovid MEDLINE; Ovid MEDLINE (In‐Process & Other Non‐Indexed Citations); Ovid EMBASE; Ovid AMED (Allied and Complementary Medicine); and EBSCO CINAHL. Selection criteria All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in people with SSTIs that compared Chinese herbal medicines with another intervention or control. Data collection and analysis Two review authors screened the literature search results independently; there were no disagreements. Main results We identified no RCTs that met the inclusion criteria. Authors' conclusions There is currently no information available from RCTs to support or refute the use of Chinese herbal medicines in treating people with SSTIs. Plain language summary Should Chinese herbal medicines be used in patients with skin and soft‐tissue infections? What are skin and soft‐tissue infections?   Skin and soft‐tissue infections (SSTIs) are common infections of the skin or the tissue beneath the skin. They include impetigo, abscesses, cellulitis, erysipelas, necrotising (flesh‐killing) skin infections, infections caused by animal or human bites or by animal contact, and infections after surgery. Most SSTIs do not require treatment, but heal by themselves. Some SSTIs are more serious and can become life‐threatening, and these need medical treatment. What are Chinese herbal medicines?   Chinese herbal medicines are mostly extracts of plants, or parts of plants, that are used individually, or combined, as medicines. These traditional medicines have been used in China for centuries, and Chinese doctors currently prescribe them to treat SSTIs. Why use Chinese herbal medicines for SSTIs?   In the Western world antibiotics are used to treat SSTIs, however antibiotics are expensive, can cause harms (side effects) as well as benefits, are not suitable for all people, and are becoming less effective as bacteria start to develop resistance to them. Alternative treatments need to be identified, and Chinese herbal medicines could provide that alternative. The purpose of this review   The aim of this review was to see if medical research showed whether Chinese herbal medicines are an effective treatment for SSTIs. We wanted to compare the use of Chinese herbal medicines with other treatments, or a fake treatment (placebo), to see which produced a better outcome for patients in a particular type of medical study called a 'randomised controlled trial'. Findings of this review   We could not find any randomised controlled trials that compared the use of Chinese herbal medicines for treating SSTIs with other treatments or a placebo. Therefore, we cannot support or refute the use of Chinese herbal medicines to treat SSTIs. In future, we hope that randomised controlled trials will be conducted to evaluate the benefits and side effects of Chinese herbal medicines compared with current practice for the treatment of SSTIs. These trials would help people and doctors to decide on the best way to treatment SSTIs.},

abstract = {Abstract - Background Hordeolum is an acute, purulent inflammation of the eyelid margin usually caused by obstructed orifices of the sebaceous glands of the eyelid. The condition, which affects sebaceous glands internally or externally, is common. When the meibomian gland in the tarsal plate is affected, internal hordeolum occurs, while when the glands of Zeis or Moll associated with eyelash follicles are affected, external hordeolum, or stye occurs. The onset of hordeolum is usually self limited, and may resolve in about a week with spontaneous drainage of the abscess. When the condition is severe, it can spread to adjacent glands and tissues. Recurrences are very common. As long as an internal hordeolum remains unresolved, it can develop into a chalazion or generalized eyelid cellulitis. Acupuncture is a traditional Chinese medical therapy aimed to treat disease by using fine needles to stimulate specific points on the body. However, it is unclear if acupuncture is an effective and safe treatment for acute hordeolum. Objectives The objective of this review was to investigate the effectiveness and safety of acupuncture to treat acute hordeolum compared with no treatment, sham acupuncture, or other active treatment. We also compared the effectiveness and safety of acupuncture plus another treatment with that treatment alone. Search methods We searched CENTRAL, Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid MEDLINE In‐Process and Other Non‐Indexed Citations, Ovid MEDLINE Daily, Ovid OLDMEDLINE, Embase, PubMed, Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature Database (LILACS), three major Chinese databases, as well as clinical trial registers all through 7 June 2016. We reviewed the reference lists from potentially eligible studies to identify additional randomised clinical trials (RCTs). Selection criteria We included RCTs of people diagnosed with acute internal or external hordeola. We included RCTs comparing acupuncture with sham acupuncture or no treatment, other active treatments, or comparing acupuncture plus another treatment versus another treatment alone. Data collection and analysis We used standard methodological procedures used by Cochrane. Main results We included 6 RCTs with a total of 531 participants from China. The mean age of the participants ranged from 18 to 28 years. Four RCTs included participants diagnosed with initial acute hordeolum with a duration of less than seven days; one RCT included participants diagnosed with initial acute hordeolum without specifying the duration; and one RCT included participants with recurrent acute hordeolum with a mean duration of 24 days. About 55% (291/531) of participants were women. Three RCTs included participants with either external or internal hordeolum; one RCT included participants with only external hordeolum; and two RCTs did not specify the type of hordeolum. Follow‐up was no more than seven days after treatment in all included RCTs; no data were available for long‐term outcomes. Overall, the certainty of the evidence for all outcomes was low to very low, and we judged all RCTs to be at high or unclear risk of bias. Three RCTs compared acupuncture with conventional treatments. We did not pool the data from these RCTs because the conventional treatments were not similar among trials. Two trials showed that resolution of acute hordeolum was more likely in the acupuncture group when compared with topical antibiotics (1 RCT; 32 participants; risk ratio (RR) 3.60; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.34 to 9.70; low‐certainty of evidence) or oral antibiotics plus warm compresses (1 RCT; 120 participants; RR 1.45; 95% CI 1.18 to 1.78; low‐certainty of evidence). In the third trial, little or no difference in resolution of hordeolum was observed when acupuncture was compared with topical antibiotics plus warm compresses (1 RCT; 109 participants; RR 1.00; 95% CI 0.96 to 1.04; low‐certainty of evidence). One RCT mentioned adverse outcomes, stating that there was no adverse event associated with acupuncture. Three RCTs compared acupuncture plus conventional treatments (two RCTs used topical antibiotics and warm compresses, one RCT used topical antibiotics only) versus the conventional treatments alone. One of the three RCTs, with very low‐certainty evidence, did not report the resolution of acute hordeolum; however, it reported that acute hordeolum relief might be higher when acupuncture was combined with conventional treatments than with conventional treatments alone group (60 participants; RR 1.80; 95% CI 1.00 to 3.23). Pooled analysis of the remaining two RCTs, with low‐certainty evidence, estimated resolution of acute hordeolum was slightly higher in the combined treatment group compared with the conventional treatment alone group at 7‐day follow‐up (210 participants; RR 1.12; 95% CI 1.03 to 1.23; I 2  = 0%). None of the three RCTs reported adverse outcomes. Among the included RCTs, four participants, two from the acupuncture plus conventional treatments group and two from the conventional treatments alone group, withdrew due to exacerbation of symptoms. Authors' conclusions Low‐certainty evidence suggests that acupuncture with or without conventional treatments may provide short‐term benefits for treating acute hordeolum when compared with conventional treatments alone. The certainty of the evidence was low to very low mainly due to small sample sizes, inadequate allocation concealment, lack of masking of the outcome assessors, inadequate or unclear randomization method, and a high or unreported number of dropouts. All RCTs were conducted in China, which may limit their generalizability to non‐Chinese populations. Because no RCTs included a valid sham acupuncture control, we cannot rule out a potential expectation/placebo effect associated with acupuncture. As resolution is based on clinical observation, the outcome could be influenced by the observer's knowledge of the assigned treatment. Adverse effects of acupuncture were reported sparsely in the included RCTs, and, when reported, were rare. RCTs with better methodology, longer follow‐up, and which are conducted among other populations are warranted to provide more general evidence regarding the benefit of acupuncture to treat acute hordeolum. Plain language summary Acupuncture for acute hordeolum (stye) What is the aim of this review?   The aim of this Cochrane review was to compare the benefits and harms of acupuncture versus conventional treatments used for treating acute hordeolum (stye). Key messages   Acupuncture, either alone or alongside conventional treatments, may increase the chance of hordeolum getting better (low‐certainty evidence). There is a lack of information on adverse effects. Studies that have a longer follow‐up and a more diverse study population are needed to tell if acupuncture really is a beneficial treatment. What was studied in this review?   Hordeolum the medical name for a stye. It is a small painful lump, or abscess, on the inside or outside of the eyelid. Typically, hordeolum goes away on its own within a week or so. However, serious cases of hordeolum can infect nearby tissues and glands. This infection can result in serious eyelid conditions. Common treatments for hordeolum include warm compresses applied at home, available over‐the‐counter topical medications and lid scrubs, antibiotics or steroids, lid massages, and other treatments. In East Asian countries, acupuncture is used to treat hordeolum, either alone or alongside these conventional treatments. According to the philosophy of traditional Chinese acupuncture, energy circulates in ‘meridians’ (or channels) through the body. When the meridian energy circulation is blocked by pathogenic factors, pain or ill health occurs. The way to restore health is to use fine needles to stimulate the appropriate acupuncture points in the body. The purpose of this review was to compare acupuncture with no treatment, sham acupuncture, or conventional treatment to determine which treatment works best for acute hordeolum. What are the main results of the review?   We found six studies from China, including a total of 531 people. The follow‐up was no more than seven days after treatment. Three studies compared acupuncture with different conventional treatments and three studies compared acupuncture plus conventional treatments versus conventional treatments alone. The review showed that: • Acupuncture may increase the chance of the hordeolum getting better compared with using antibiotics and/or warm compresses (low‐certainty evidence).  • Acupuncture combined with antibiotics and/or warm compresses compared with antibiotics and/or warm compresses may slightly increase the chance of the hordeolum getting better (low‐certainty evidence).  • It is uncertain whether there are any harmful effects of acupuncture for hordeolum. How up‐to‐date is this review?   Cochrane researchers searched for studies that had been published up to 7 June 2016.},

Interventions that are effective and safe for maintenance of remission in CD are desirable. Objectives The primary objectives were to evaluate the efficacy and safety of enteral nutrition for the maintenance of remission in CD and to assess the impact of formula composition on effectiveness. Search methods We searched MEDLINE, Embase, CENTRAL, the Cochrane IBD Group Specialized Register and clinicaltrials.gov from inception to 27 July 2018. We also searched references of retrieved studies and reviews. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) including participants of any age with quiescent CD were considered for inclusion. Studies that compared enteral nutrition with no intervention, placebo or any other intervention were selected for review. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently screened studies for inclusion, extracted data and assessed methodological quality using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. The primary outcome was clinical or endoscopic relapse as defined by the primary studies. Secondary outcomes included anthropometric measures (i.e. height and weight), quality of life (QoL), adverse events, serious adverse events and withdrawal due to adverse events. We calculated the risk ratio and 95% confidence interval (CI) for dichotomous outcomes. For continuous outcomes, we calculated the mean difference and 95% CI. A random‐effects model was used for the statistical analysis. We used the GRADE criteria to assess the overall certainty of the evidence supporting the primary outcome and selected secondary outcomes. Main results Four RCTs (262 adult participants) met the inclusion criteria. One study (N = 33) compared an elemental diet to a non‐elemental (polymeric) diet. One study (N = 51) compared a half elemental diet to a regular free diet. Another study (N = 95) compared an elemental diet to 6‐mercaptopurine (6‐MP) or a no treatment control group. One study (N= 83) compared a polymeric diet to mesalamine. Two studies were rated as high risk of bias due to lack of blinding or incomplete outcome data. The other two studies were judged to have an unclear risk of bias. The studies were not pooled due to differences in control interventions and the way outcomes were assessed. The effect of an elemental diet compared to a polymeric diet on remission rates or withdrawal due to adverse events is uncertain. Fifty‐eight per cent (11/19) of participants in the elemental diet group relapsed at 12 months compared to 57% (8/14) of participants in the polymeric diet group (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.56 to 1.84; very low certainty evidence). Thirty‐two per cent (6/19) of participants in the elemental diet group were intolerant to the enteral nutritional formula because of taste or smell and were withdrawn from the study in the first 2 weeks compared to zero participants (0/14) in the polymeric diet group (RR 9.75, 95% CI 0.59 to 159.93; low certainty evidence). Anthropometric measures, QoL, adverse events and serious adverse events were not reported as outcomes. The effect of an elemental diet (half of total daily calorie requirements) compared to a normal free diet on relapse rates is uncertain. Thirty‐five per cent (9/26) of participants in the elemental diet group relapsed at 12 months compared to 64% (16/25) of participants in the free diet group (RR 0.54, 95% CI 0.30 to 0.99; very low certainty evidence). No adverse events were reported. This study reported no differences in weight change between the two diet groups. Height and QoL were not reported as outcomes. The effect of an elemental diet compared to 6‐MP on relapse rates or adverse events is uncertain. Thirty‐eight per cent (12/32) of participants in the elemental diet group relapsed at 12 months compared to 23% (7/30) of participants in the 6‐MP group (RR 1.61; 95% CI 0.73 to 3.53; very low certainty evidence). Three per cent (1/32) of participants in the elemental diet group had an adverse event compared to 13% (4/30) of participants in the 6‐MP group (RR 0.23, 95% CI 0.03 to 1.98; low certainty evidence). Adverse events in the elemental diet group included surgery due to worsening CD. Adverse events in the 6‐MP group included liver injury (n = 2), hair loss (n = 1) and surgery due to an abscess (n = 1). No serious adverse events or withdrawals due to adverse events were reported. Weight, height and QoL were not reported as outcomes The effect of a polymeric diet compared to mesalamine on relapse rates and weight is uncertain. Forty‐two per cent (18/43) of participants in the polymeric diet group relapsed at 6 months compared to 55% (22/40) of participants in the mesalamine group (RR 0.76; 95% CI 0.49 to 1.19; low certainty evidence). The mean difference in weight gain over the study period was 1.9 kg higher in the polymeric diet group compared to mesalamine (95% CI ‐4.62 to 8.42; low certainty evidence). Two participants in the polymeric diet group experienced nausea and four had diarrhoea. It is unclear if any participants in the mesalamine group had an adverse event. Height, QoL, serious adverse events and withdrawal due to adverse events were not reported as outcomes. Authors' conclusions The results for the outcomes assessed in this review are uncertain and no firm conclusions regarding the efficacy and safety of enteral nutrition in quiescent CD can be drawn. More research is needed to determine the efficacy and safety of using enteral nutrition as maintenance therapy in CD. Currently, there are four ongoing studies (estimated enrolment of 280 participants). This review will be updated when the results of these studies are available. Plain language summary Enteral nutrition (liquid feeds) for maintenance of remission in Crohn's disease What is Crohn's disease? Crohn's disease is a chronic inflammatory disease of the intestines that frequently occurs in the lower part of the small intestine (ileum). Symptoms include abdominal pain, diarrhoea and weight loss. When people with Crohn's disease are experiencing symptoms the disease is considered 'active'. When the symptoms stop, it is called 'remission'. When people in remission experience symptoms it is called a 'relapse'. What is enteral nutrition? Enteral nutrition is a feeding method where a person's daily caloric intake is delivered via a liquid diet using the GI tract. Enteral nutrition can be administered by mouth or by tube feeding, where a tube is inserted through the nose or abdomen into the stomach to deliver the liquid feed. Enteral nutrition is a form of nutritional therapy for Crohn's disease patients. The mechanism by which enteral nutrition may influence inflammation is unknown and is being studied. Enteral nutrition can be classified as elemental and non‐elemental (semi‐elemental and polymeric) diets. Elemental diets are composed of amino‐acids (organic compounds), fats, sugars, vitamins and minerals. Elemental diets are easily absorbed and digested. Non‐elemental diets are based on oligopeptide (organic compounds composed of 2 to 20 amino‐acids) or whole protein sources. Non‐elemental diets are best for people who can digest and absorb nutrients without difficulty. What is 6‐mercaptopurine? 6‐Mercaptopurine is an immunosuppressive drug that is thought to reduce inflammation in people with Crohn's disease by blocking the immune system. What is mesalamine? Mesalamine is a 5‐aminosalicylic acid drug. 5‐Aminosalicylic drugs are thought to treat Crohn's disease by reducing inflammation in the gastrointestinal tract. These drugs are usually taken by mouth. What did the researchers investigate? The researchers studied whether enteral nutrition helps to maintain remission in people with Crohn's disease. The researchers also investigated whether one type of enteral nutrition was better than another (e.g. elemental vs.non‐elemental) for maintaining remission in people with Crohn's disease. What did the researchers find? Four studies including 262 adult participants with Crohn's disease in remission were included. One study (33 participants) compared an elemental diet to a non‐elemental (polymeric) diet. One study (51 participants) compared an elemental diet to a normal diet (no supplements). One study (95 participants) compared an elemental diet to 6‐mercaptopurine or a no treatment control group. One study (83 participants) compared a non‐elemental polymeric diet to mesalamine. The researchers searched the medical literature extensively up to 27 July 2018. The study comparing an elemental diet to a polymeric diet found no difference in remission rates at 12 months. Six elemental diet participants were not able to tolerate the enteral nutritional formula because of taste or smell and were withdrawn from the study. Participants who received half of their total daily calorie requirements as elemental diet and the remaining half by normal diet had a lower chance of relapse at 12 months compared to participants who received a free diet. No side effects were reported in this study. The study comparing an elemental diet to 6‐mercaptopurine did not show any difference in relapse rates at 12 months. There was no difference in side effect rates. The only side effect reported in the elemental diet group was surgery due to worsening Crohn's disease. Side effects in the 6‐mercaptopurine group included liver injury in two participants, hair loss in one participant and surgery to treat an abscess in one participant. The study comparing a polymeric diet to mesalamine found no difference in relapse rates at six months. Two participants the polymeric diet group experienced nausea and four had diarrhoea. It is unclear if any participants in the mesalamine group had side effects. No serious side effects were reported in any of the studies. The results for the outcomes assessed in this review are uncertain and no firm conclusions regarding the effectiveness and safety of enteral nutrition for maintenance of remission in Crohn's disease can be drawn. More research is needed to determine the effectiveness and safety of using enteral nutrition as maintenance therapy in Crohn's disease. Currently, there are four ongoing studies (estimated enrolment of 280 participants). This review will be updated when the results of these studies are available.},

abstract = {Abstract - Background Pancreatic cancer remains one of the five leading causes of cancer deaths in industrialized nations. For adenocarcinomas in the head of the gland and premalignant lesions, partial pancreaticoduodenectomy represents the standard treatment for resectable tumours. The gastro‐ or duodenojejunostomy after partial pancreaticoduodenectomy can be reestablished via either an antecolic or a retrocolic route. The debate about the more favourable technique for bowel reconstruction is ongoing. Objectives To compare the effectiveness and safety of antecolic and retrocolic gastro‐ or duodenojejunostomy after partial pancreaticoduodenectomy. Search methods We conducted a systematic literature search on 29 September 2015 to identify all randomised controlled trials in the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL),  The Cochrane Library  2015, issue 9, MEDLINE (1946 to September 2015), and EMBASE (1974 to September 2015). We applied no language restrictions. We handsearched reference lists of identified trials to identify further relevant trials, and searched the trial registry  clinicaltrials.gov  for ongoing trials. Selection criteria We considered all randomised controlled trials that compared antecolic versus retrocolic reconstruction of bowel continuity after partial pancreaticoduodenectomy for any given indication to be eligible. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently screened the identified references and extracted data from the included trials. The same two review authors independently assessed risk of bias of included trials, according to standard Cochrane methodology. We used a random‐effects model to pool the results of the individual trials in a meta‐analysis. We used odds ratios to compare binary outcomes and mean differences for continuous outcomes. Main results Of a total of 216 citations identified by the systematic literature search, we included six randomised controlled trials (reported in nine publications), with a total of 576 participants. We identified a moderate heterogeneity of methodological quality and risk of bias of the included trials. None of the pooled results for our main outcomes of interest showed significant differences: delayed gastric emptying (OR 0.60; 95% CI 0.31 to 1.18; P = 0.14), mortality (RD ‐0.01; 95% CI ‐0.03 to 0.02; P = 0.72), postoperative pancreatic fistula (OR 0.98; 95% CI 0.65 to 1.47; P = 0.92), postoperative haemorrhage (OR 0.79; 95% CI 0.38 to 1.65; P = 0.53), intra‐abdominal abscess (OR 0.93; 95% CI 0.52 to 1.67; P = 0.82), bile leakage (OR 0.89; 95% CI 0.36 to 2.15; P = 0.79), reoperation rate (OR 0.59; 95% CI 0.27 to 1.31; P = 0.20), and length of hospital stay (MD ‐0.67; 95%CI ‐2.85 to 1.51; P = 0.55). Furthermore, the perioperative outcomes duration of operation, intraoperative blood loss and time to NGT removal showed no relevant differences. Only one trial reported quality of life, on a subgroup of participants, also without a significant difference between the two groups at any time point. The overall quality of the evidence was only low to moderate, due to heterogeneity, some inconsistency and risk of bias in the included trials. Authors' conclusions There was low to moderate quality evidence suggesting no significant differences in morbidity, mortality, length of hospital stay, or quality of life between antecolic and retrocolic reconstruction routes for gastro‐ or duodenojejunostomy. Due to heterogeneity in definitions of the endpoints between trials, and differences in postoperative management, future research should be based on clearly defined endpoints and standardised perioperative management, to potentially elucidate differences between these two procedures. Novel strategies should be evaluated for prophylaxis and treatment of common complications, such as delayed gastric emptying. Plain language summary Comparison of bowel reconstruction routes after partial surgical removal of the pancreas and duodenum (first part of the small intestine)                 Background              The pancreas is a digestive gland situated in the upper abdomen, which is also vital to normal control of blood sugar. Pancreatic cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer death in industrialized nations. The standard surgical treatment for cancer of the head of the gland and precancerous abnormalities is partial removal of the pancreas, together with the attached duodenum, known as a pancreaticoduodenectomy. Removal of the duodenum requires the restoration of the digestive pathway from the stomach to the rest of the gut. This can be accomplished by joining it to the jejunum (second part of the small intestine) either in front of (antecolic) or behind (retrocolic) the overlying large intestine (transverse colon).                 Review question              It is unclear whether one of these two routes of reconstruction provides a benefit to the patient by reducing delayed gastric emptying (emptying of the stomach after ingestion of food); postoperative mortality (death); and other complications, such as pancreatic fistula (leakage of pancreatic juice), reoperation, perioperative measures (before, during, and after the operation), or length of hospital stay; and improving quality of life. Delayed gastric emptying was the primary outcome of this review because it is one of the most frequent complications after a pancreaticoduodenectomy; it can make it difficult to take anything by mouth and interferes with the patient’s quality of life, often resulting in a prolonged hospital stay and delay of further treatment.                 Study characteristics              We included six randomised controlled trials (reported in nine publications), reporting data on a total of 576 adult participants, who underwent pancreaticoduodenectomy for any pancreatic disease. The evidence is current to September 2015.                 Key results              We did not identify significant differences in delayed gastric emptying; postoperative mortality; postoperative pancreatic fistula, or other complications; reoperations; or length of hospital stay. Quality of life, only reported for a subset of participants in one trial, did not differ between the two groups. Our results do not suggest any relevant differences between antecolic and retrocolic reconstruction of the gastro‐ or duodenojejunostomy after partial pancreaticoduodenectomy.                 Quality of evidence              The quality of the evidence was only low to moderate, due to clinical and statistical differences between individual trials, and risk of bias, due to shortcomings in the way the trials were conducted. Therefore, the results should be viewed with caution.},

abstract = {Abstract - Background Pilonidal sinus arises in the hair follicles in the buttock cleft. The estimated incidence is 26 per 100,000, people, affecting men twice as often as women. These chronic discharging wounds cause pain and impact upon quality of life. Surgical strategies centre on excision of the sinus tracts followed by primary closure and healing by primary intention or leaving the wound open to heal by secondary intention. There is uncertainty as to whether open or closed surgical management is more effective. Objectives To determine the relative effects of open compared with closed surgical treatment for pilonidal sinus on the outcomes of time to healing, infection and recurrence rate. Search methods For this first update we searched the Wounds Group Specialised Register (24/9/09); The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) ‐ The Cochrane Library Issue 3 2009; Ovid MEDLINE (1950 ‐ September Week 3, 2009); Ovid MEDLINE(R) In‐Process & Other Non‐Indexed Citations (September 24, 2009); Ovid EMBASE (1980 ‐ 2009 Week 38); EBSCO CINAHL (1982 ‐ September Week 3, 2009). Selection criteria All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing open with closed surgical treatment for pilonidal sinus. Exclusion criteria were: non‐RCTs; children aged younger than 14 years and studies of pilonidal abscess. Data collection and analysis Data extraction and risk of bias assessment were conducted independently by three review authors (AA/IM/JB). Mean differences were used for continuous outcomes and relative risks with 95% confidence intervals for dichotomous outcomes. Main results For this update, 8 additional trials were identified giving a total of 26 included studies (n=2530). 17 studies compared open wound healing with surgical closure. Healing times were faster after surgical closure compared with open healing. Surgical site infection (SSI) rates did not differ between treatments; recurrence rates were lower in open healing than with primary closure (RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.42 to 0.87). Six studies compared surgical midline with off‐midline closure. Healing times were faster after off‐midline closure (MD 5.4 days, 95% CI 2.3 to 8.5). SSI rates were higher after midline closure (RR 3.72, 95% CI 1.86 to 7.42) and recurrence rates were higher after midline closure (Peto OR 4.54, 95% CI 2.30 to 8.96). Authors' conclusions No clear benefit was shown for open healing over surgical closure. A clear benefit was shown in favour of off‐midline rather than midline wound closure. When closure of pilonidal sinuses is the desired surgical option, off‐midline closure should be the standard management.  Plain language summary Healing by primary versus secondary intention after surgical treatment for pilonidal sinus Pilonidal sinus is a very common disease of the buttock region which mostly affects young adults (men more than women) and for many with the disease, the condition can be painful and long‐lasting (chronic). The disease is thought to arise from ingrowing hair between the buttocks, which then becomes infected and forms into a "sinus" or tract. Patients with a pilonidal sinus usually present to their doctor with painful swelling around the buttock area, which may discharge pus‐like substance. This disease is usually treated by surgery. Surgeons agree that the area where the infection has developed should be completely incised and removed. However, surgeons have not agreed whether the resulting wound should be stitched closed or left open to heal without stitches. This review of the published literature found that patients who had their wounds closed with stitches healed faster and returned to work earlier than patients whose wounds were left unstitched and allowed to heal "naturally". However, the review also found that patients who had their wounds closed with stitches were more likely to get the disease again compared to those who did not have their wounds closed by stitches. This means that each type of surgical treatment has its advantages and disadvantages, and that the decision about which type of surgical wound to select should also be guided by the patient's own desired goals for treatment. The review also found that if a decision had been made to close the wound with stitches, then the best way to reduce the risk of the disease coming back and reduce other complications (such as infection), was to use a wound technique where the line of stitches was moved away from between the buttocks. Therefore one definitive recommendation from this systematic review is that where a decision has been made to close the sinus wound using stitches, this wound should not lie in the central area of the buttocks.      },

abstract = {Abstract - Background Urinary tract infection (UTI) is a common bacterial infection that can lead to significant morbidity including stricture, abscess formation, fistula, bacteraemia, sepsis, pyelonephritis and kidney dysfunction. Mortality rates are reported to be as high as 1% in men and 3% in women due to development of pyelonephritis. Because probiotic therapy is readily available without a prescription, a review of their efficacy in the prevention of UTI may aid consumers in making informed decisions about potential prophylactic therapy. Institutions and caregivers also need evidence‐based synopses of current evidence to make informed patient care decisions. Objectives Compared to placebo or no therapy, did probiotics (any formulation) provide a therapeutic advantage in terms of morbidity and mortality, when used to prevent UTI in susceptible patient populations? Compared to other prophylactic interventions, including drug and non‐drug measures (e.g. continuous antibiotic prophylaxis, topical oestrogen, cranberry juice), did probiotics (any formulation) provide a therapeutic advantage in terms of morbidity and mortality when used to prevent UTIs in susceptible patient populations? Search methods We searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Specialised Register to 21 September 2015 through contact with the Trials' Search Co‐ordinator using search terms relevant to this review. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of susceptible patients (e.g. past history of UTI) or healthy people in which any strain, formulation, dose or frequency of probiotic was compared to placebo or active comparators were included. Data collection and analysis All RCTs and quasi‐RCTs (RCTs in which allocation to treatment was obtained by alternation, use of alternate medical records, date of birth or other predictable methods) looking at comparing probiotics to no therapy, placebo, or other prophylactic interventions were included. Summary estimates of effect were obtained using a random‐effects model, and results were expressed as risk ratios (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) for dichotomous outcomes. Main results We included nine studies that involved 735 people in this review. Four studies compared probiotic with placebo, two compared probiotic with no treatment, two compared probiotics with antibiotics in patients with UTI, and one study compared probiotic with placebo in healthy women. All studies aimed to measure differences in rates of recurrent UTI. Our risk of bias assessment found that most studies had small sample sizes and reported insufficient methodological detail to enable robust assessment. Overall, there was a high risk of bias in the included studies which lead to inability to draw firm conclusions and suggesting that any reported treatment effects may be misleading or represent overestimates. We found no significant reduction in the risk of recurrent symptomatic bacterial UTI between patients treated with probiotics and placebo (6 studies, 352 participants: RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.60 to 1.12; I 2  = 23%) with wide confidence intervals, and statistical heterogeneity was low. No significant reduction in the risk of recurrent symptomatic bacterial UTI was found between probiotic and antibiotic treated patients (1 study, 223 participants: RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.33). The most commonly reported adverse effects were diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, constipation and vaginal symptoms. None of the included studies reported numbers of participants with at least one asymptomatic bacterial UTI, all‐cause mortality or those with at least one confirmed case of bacteraemia or fungaemia. Two studies reported study withdrawal due to adverse events and the number of participants who experienced at least one adverse event. One study reported withdrawal occurred in six probiotic participants (5.2%), 15 antibiotic participants (12.2%), while the second study noted one placebo group participant discontinued treatment due to an adverse event. Authors' conclusions No significant benefit was demonstrated for probiotics compared with placebo or no treatment, but a benefit cannot be ruled out as the data were few, and derived from small studies with poor methodological reporting. There was limited information on harm and mortality with probiotics and no evidence on the impact of probiotics on serious adverse events. Current evidence cannot rule out a reduction or increase in recurrent UTI in women with recurrent UTI who use prophylactic probiotics. There was insufficient evidence from one RCT to comment on the effect of probiotics versus antibiotics. Plain language summary Probiotics for preventing urinary tract infections in adults and children Background Urinary tract infections (UTIs) occur in kidneys, ureters, urethra or bladder. UTIs are one of the most common bacterial infections and can lead to other health problems. Probiotics (live micro‐organisms which, when administered in adequate amounts, confer a health benefit on the host) are thought to work by preventing other infectious bacteria from climbing up the urinary tract and causing infection. We were interested in studying any form of probiotics (bacteria used to change balance of bacteria) compared with no treatment, antibiotics, hormone therapy, cranberry juice or other interventions in people at risk of UTI. To assess if probiotics were effective, we planned to measure how many people had recurrent UTIs. Study characteristics We conducted a literature search up to September 2015 and nine studies were eligible for inclusion according to our selection criteria. The nine studies reported data on 735 participants and investigated probiotics for preventing UTI: seven studies involved women or girls with recurrent UTIs, one looked at children with abnormal urinary tracts, and one investigated UTI in healthy women. Key results Generally, studies were poor quality with high risk of bias. Aside from the different populations, there were also many different species of probiotics used, different dosage forms such as vaginal and oral, and probiotics were given for varying lengths of time. All of these factors may have affected our results. Most studies did not collect information on adverse effects so we were unable to estimate any harms associated with probiotic therapies. We found no significant reduction in the risk of recurrent symptomatic bacterial UTI between patients treated with probiotics and placebo and no significant reduction in the risk of recurrent symptomatic bacterial UTI was found between probiotic and patients treated with antibiotics. Quality of the evidence The currently available evidence shows no reduction in UTI using probiotics.},

abstract = {Abstract - Background Caesarean section increases the risk of postpartum infection for women and prophylactic antibiotics have been shown to reduce the incidence; however, there are adverse effects. It is important to identify the most effective class of antibiotics to use and those with the least adverse effects. Objectives To determine, from the best available evidence, the balance of benefits and harms between different classes of antibiotic given prophylactically to women undergoing caesarean section. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (30 September 2014) and reference lists of retrieved papers. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials comparing different classes of prophylactic antibiotics given to women undergoing caesarean section. We excluded trials that compared drugs with placebo or drugs within a specific class; these are assessed in other Cochrane reviews. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently assessed the studies for inclusion, assessed risk of bias and carried out data extraction. Main results We included 35 studies of which 31 provided data on 7697 women. For the main comparison between cephalosporins versus penicillins, there were 30 studies of which 27 provided data on 7299 women. There was a lack of good quality data and important outcomes often included only small numbers of women. For the comparison of a single cephalosporin versus a single penicillin (Comparison 1 subgroup 1), we found no significant difference between these classes of antibiotics for our chosen most important seven outcomes namely: maternal sepsis ‐ there were no women with sepsis in the two studies involving 346 women; maternal endometritis (risk ratio (RR) 1.11, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.81 to 1.52, nine studies, 3130 women, random effects,  moderate quality of the evidence ); maternal wound infection (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.38 to 1.81, nine studies, 1497 women, random effects,  low quality of the evidence ), maternal urinary tract infection (RR 1.48, 95% CI 0.89 to 2.48, seven studies, 1120 women,  low quality of the evidence ) and maternal composite adverse effects (RR 2.02, 95% CI 0.18 to 21.96, three studies, 1902 women,  very low quality of the evidence ). None of the included studies looked for infant sepsis nor infant oral thrush. This meant we could only conclude that the current evidence shows no overall difference between the different classes of antibiotics in terms of reducing maternal infections after caesarean sections. However, none of the studies reported on infections diagnosed after the initial postoperative hospital stay. We were unable to assess what impact, if any, the use of different classes of antibiotics might have on bacterial resistance. Authors' conclusions Based on the best currently available evidence, cephalosporins and penicillins have similar efficacy at caesarean section when considering immediate postoperative infections. We have no data for outcomes on the baby, nor on late infections (up to 30 days) in the mother. Clinicians need to consider bacterial resistance and women's individual circumstances. Plain language summary Comparing different types of antibiotics given routinely to women at caesarean section to prevent infections Background Women undergoing caesarean section have an increased likelihood of infection compared with women who give birth vaginally. These infections can be in the urine, surgical incision, or the lining of the womb (endometritis). The infections can become serious, causing, for example, an abscess in the pelvis or infection in the blood, and very occasionally can lead to the mother's death. Sound surgical techniques are important for reducing infections, along with skin antiseptics and antibiotics. However, antibiotics can cause adverse effects such as nausea, vomiting, skin rash and rarely allergic reactions in the mother, and the risk of thrush (candida) for the mother and the baby. Antibiotics, given to women around the time of giving birth, can also change the baby's gut flora and thus may interfere with the baby's developing immune system. Our review question We asked if cephalosporin antibiotics were better than penicillins for women having a caesarean section. We also looked to see how other groups of antibiotics compared. What we found When comparing cephalosporins against penicillins, we found 27 studies, involving 7299 women as of September 2014. The quality of the studies was generally unclear and three studies reported drug company funding. Cephalosporins and penicillins had similar effects in reducing infections after caesareans and similar adverse effects. However, none of the studies considered infections after the women left hospital. None of the studies looked at outcomes on the babies. Other evidence show tetracyclines can cause discolouration of teeth in children and are best avoided. Consideration also needs to be given to antibiotics compatible with breastfeeding. We were unable to assess bacterial resistance, and this is crucial when considering which antibiotic might be used. What our results mean At caesarean sections, cephalosporins and penicillins have similar benefits and side effects for mothers when considering infections immediately following the operation but there is no information on babies. Clinicians need to consider bacterial resistance and women's individual circumstances.},

abstract = {Abstract - Background This is an update of the review last published in 2011. It focuses on early postoperative enteral nutrition after lower gastrointestinal surgery. Traditional management consisted of 'nil by mouth', where patients receive fluids followed by solids after bowel function has returned. Although several trials have reported lower incidence of infectious complications and faster wound healing upon early feeding, other trials have shown no effect. The immediate advantage of energy intake (carbohydrates, protein or fat) could enhance recovery with fewer complications, and this warrants a systematic evaluation. Objectives To evaluate whether early commencement of postoperative enteral nutrition (within 24 hours), oral intake and any kind of tube feeding (gastric, duodenal or jejunal), compared with traditional management (delayed nutritional supply) is associated with a shorter length of hospital stay (LoS), fewer complications, mortality and adverse events in patients undergoing lower gastrointestinal surgery (distal to the ligament of Treitz). Search methods We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, the Cochrane Library 2017, issue 10), Ovid MEDLINE (1950 to 15 November 2017), Ovid Embase (1974 to 15 November 2017). We also searched for ongoing trials in ClinicalTrials.gov and World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (15 November 2017). We handsearched reference lists of identified studies and previous systematic reviews. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials (RCT) comparing early commencement of enteral nutrition (within 24 hours) with no feeding in adult participants undergoing lower gastrointestinal surgery. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently assessed study quality using the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool tailored to this review and extracted data. Data analyses were conducted according to the Cochrane recommendations.    We rated the quality of evidence according to GRADE.    Primary outcomes were LoS and postoperative complications (wound infections, intraabdominal abscesses, anastomotic dehiscence, pneumonia).    Secondary outcomes were: mortality, adverse events (nausea, vomiting), and quality of life (QoL).    LoS was estimated using mean difference (MD (presented as mean +/‐ SD). For other outcomes we estimated the common risk ratio (RR) and calculated the associated 95% confidence intervals. For analysis, we used an inverse‐variance random‐effects model for the primary outcome (LoS) and Mantel‐Haenszel random‐effects models for the secondary outcomes. We also performed Trial Sequential Analyses (TSA). Main results We identified 17 RCTs with 1437 participants undergoing lower gastrointestinal surgery. Most studies were at high or unclear risk of bias in two or more domains. Six studies were judged as having low risk of selection bias for random sequence generation and insufficient details were provided for judgement on allocation concealment in all 17 studies. With regards to performance and deception bias; 14 studies reported no attempt to blind participants and blinding of personnel was not discussed either. Only one study was judged as low risk of bias for blinding of outcome assessor. With regards to incomplete outcome data, three studies were judged to be at high risk because they had more than 10% difference in missing data between groups. For selective reporting, nine studies were judged as unclear as protocols were not provided and eight studies had issues with either missing data or incomplete reporting of results. LOS was reported in 16 studies (1346 participants). The mean LoS ranged from four days to 16 days in the early feeding groups and from 6.6 days to 23.5 days in the control groups. Mean difference (MD) in LoS was 1.95 (95% CI, ‐2.99 to ‐0.91, P < 0.001) days shorter in the early feeding group. However, there was substantial heterogeneity between included studies (I 2  = 81, %, Chi 2  = 78.98, P < 0.00001), thus the overall quality of evidence for LoS is low. These results were confirmed by the TSA showing that the cumulative Z‐curve crossed the trial sequential monitoring boundary for benefit.    We found no differences in the incidence of postoperative complications: wound infection (12 studies, 1181 participants, RR 0.99, 95%CI 0.64 to 1.52, very low‐quality evidence), intraabdominal abscesses (6 studies, 554 participants, RR 1.00, 95%CI 0.26 to 3.80, low‐quality evidence), anastomotic leakage/dehiscence (13 studies, 1232 participants, RR 0.78, 95%CI 0.38 to 1.61, low‐quality evidence; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) = 100), and pneumonia (10 studies, 954 participants, RR 0.88, 95%CI 0.32 to 2.42, low‐quality evidence; NNTB = 333). Mortality was reported in 12 studies (1179 participants), and showed no between‐group differences (RR = 0.56, 95%CI, 0.21 to 1.52, P = 0.26, I 2  = 0%, Chi 2  = 3.08, P = 0.96, low‐quality evidence). The most commonly reported cause of death was anastomotic leakage, sepsis and acute myocardial infarction. Seven studies (613 participants) reported vomiting (RR 1.23, 95%CI, 0.96 to 1.58, P = 0.10, I 2  = 0%, Chi 2  = 4.98, P = 0.55, low‐quality evidence; number needed to treat for an additional harmful outcome (NNTH) = 19), and two studies (118 participants) reported nausea (RR 0.95, 0.71 to 1.26, low‐quality evidence). Four studies reported combined nausea and vomiting (RR 0.94, 95%CI 0.51 to 1.74, very low‐quality evidence). One study reported QoL assessment; the scores did not differ between groups at 30 days after discharge on either QoL scale EORTC QLQ‐C30 or EORTC QlQ‐OV28 (very low‐quality evidence). Authors' conclusions This review suggests that early enteral feeding may lead to a reduced postoperative LoS, however cautious interpretation must be taken due to substantial heterogeneity and low‐quality evidence. For all other outcomes (postoperative complications, mortality, adverse events, and QoL) the findings are inconclusive, and further trials are justified to enhance the understanding of early feeding for these. In this updated review, only a few additional studies have been included, and these were small and of poor quality.    To improve the evidence, future trials should address quality issues and focus on clearly defining and measuring postoperative complications to allow for better comparison between studies. However due to the introduction of fast track protocols which already include an early feeding component, future trials may be challenging. A more feasible trial may be to investigate the effect of differing postoperative energy intake regimens on relevant outcomes. Plain language summary The effect of having nutrition within the first 24 hours after bowel surgery on length of hospital stay and postoperative complications Review question To look at whether feeding patients early after surgery via their stomach (also known as gastrointestinal surgery) can help them to leave hospital sooner with fewer complications. Background Traditionally, after gastrointestinal surgery, it was usual for patients not to be given any food until their bowel regained some function (e.g. bowel sounds, passing wind, bowel motion). Studies have looked at whether feeding patients sooner after surgery can help reduce complications (e.g. pneumonia), but there are mixed results. It is important to do this update of the review because the evidence in previous reviews is not extensive. The relevance of early feeding following its incorporation within a programme of patient care (also known as the enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS)), remains an important question to answer. Study characteristics This review found 17 relevant studies that recruited 1437 participants in total who had undergone lower gastrointestinal surgery (distal to the ligament of Treitz). Key results We found evidence that patients who received nutrition within the first 24 hours after their surgery were able to leave hospital almost two days sooner than those patients who were not given any nutrition until their bowel activity returned. However, the quality of the evidence is low and therefore early feeding after surgery may not lead to patients leaving hospital sooner. They may also have a reduced risk of dying. However, we found weak evidence that patients who were given nutrition within the first day after their operation were more at risk of vomiting. There were no differences in complication rates (such as wound infection or pneumonia) between patients who were fed early and those that were not. Quality of the evidence All studies were of low quality, which may mean their results are less reliable. To explore further early feeding after surgery, more studies are needed which are larger and of better quality.},

abstract = {Abstract - Background The morbidity and treatment costs associated with skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs) are high. Linezolid and vancomycin are antibiotics that are commonly used in treating skin and soft‐tissue infections, specifically those infections due to methicillin‐resistant  Staphylococcus aureus ( MRSA). Objectives To compare the effects and safety of linezolid and vancomycin for treating people with SSTIs. Search methods For this first update of this review we conducted searches of the following databases: Cochrane Wounds Group Specialised Register (searched 24 March 2015; The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) ( The Cochrane Library ); Ovid MEDLINE; Ovid MEDLINE (In‐Process & Other Non‐Indexed Citations); Ovid EMBASE; and EBSCO CINAHL. We also contacted manufacturers for details of unpublished and ongoing trials. We scrutinised citations within all obtained trials and major review articles to identify any additional trials. Selection criteria We included all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing linezolid with vancomycin in the treatment of SSTIs. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently selected trials, assessed risk of bias and extracted data. The primary outcomes were clinical cure, microbiological cure, and SSTI‐related and treatment‐related mortality. We performed subgroup analyses according to age, and whether the infection was due to MRSA. Main results No new trials were identified for this first update. We included nine RCTs (3144 participants). Linezolid was associated with a significantly better clinical (RR 1.09, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.16) and microbiological cure rate in adults (RR 1.08, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.16). For those infections due to MRSA, linezolid was significantly more effective than vancomycin in clinical (RR 1.09, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.17) and microbiological cure rates (RR 1.17, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.32). No RCT reported SSTI‐related and treatment‐related mortality. There was no significant difference in all‐cause mortality between linezolid and vancomycin (RR 1.44, 95% CI 0.75 to 2.80). There were fewer incidents of red man syndrome (RR 0.04, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.29), pruritus (RR 0.36, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.75) and rash (RR 0.27, 95% CI 0.12 to 0.58) in the linezolid group compared with vancomycin, however, more people reported thrombocytopenia (RR 13.06, 95% CI 1.72 to 99.22), and nausea (RR 2.45, 95% CI 1.52 to 3.94) when treated with linezolid. It seems, from the available data, that length of stay in hospital was shorter for those in the linezolid group than the vancomycin group. The daily cost of outpatient therapy was less with oral linezolid than with intravenous vancomycin. Although inpatient treatment with linezolid cost more than inpatient treatment with vancomycin per day, the median length of hospital stay was three days shorter with linezolid. Thus, total hospital charges per patient were less with linezolid treatment than with vancomycin treatment. Authors' conclusions Linezolid seems to be more effective than vancomycin for treating people with SSTIs, including SSTIs caused by MRSA. The available evidence is at high risk of bias and is based on studies that were supported by the pharmaceutical company that makes linezolid. Further well‐designed, independently‐funded, RCTs are needed to confirm the available evidence. Plain language summary Antibiotic drugs for treating skin and soft tissue infections Skin and soft tissue infections such as impetigo, abscesses, ulcers, and surgical site infections are common infections of the skin. For serious skin and soft tissue infections involving the deeper tissues, the death rate and treatment costs are high. Linezolid and vancomycin are antibiotics that are effective in treating skin and soft tissue infections, particularly infections caused by bacteria that have developed resistance to some antibiotics. This review identified nine RCTs, with a total of 3144 participants, and compared treatment with linezolid against treatment with vancomycin for skin and soft tissue infections. No new trials were identified for this first update. Linezolid was found to be more effective than vancomycin for treating these infections. There were fewer skin complications in the group that were treated with linezolid. There were no differences between the two groups in the number of reported deaths, and those treated with linezolid had shorter lengths of hospital stay than those treated with vancomycin. The daily cost of outpatient therapy was less with oral linezolid than with intravenous vancomycin, although for inpatient treatment, linezolid was more expensive than vancomycin. Well‐designed trials will be required in future to confirm these results, as the trials from which these conclusions were drawn were of poor methodological quality, at high risk of bias, and were funded by the pharmaceutical company that makes linezolid.},

abstract = {Abstract - Background Infection with the protozoan  Entamoeba histolytica  is common in low‐ and middle‐income countries, and up to 100,000 people with severe disease die every year. Adequate therapy for amoebic colitis is necessary to reduce illness, prevent development of complicated disease and extraintestinal spread, and decrease transmission. Objectives To evaluate antiamoebic drugs for treating amoebic colitis. Search methods We searched the available literature up to 22 March 2018. We searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS,  m RCT, and conference proceedings. We contacted individual researchers, organizations, and pharmaceutical companies, and we checked reference lists. Selection criteria Randomized controlled trials of antiamoebic drugs given alone or in combination, compared with placebo or another antiamoebic drug, for treating adults and children with a diagnosis of amoebic colitis. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently assessed the eligibility and methodological quality of trials and extracted and analysed the data. We calculated clinical and parasitological failure rates and rates of relapse and adverse events as risk ratios (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), using a random‐effects model. We determined statistical heterogeneity and explored possible sources of heterogeneity using subgroup analyses. We carried out sensitivity analysis by using trial quality to assess the robustness of reported results. Main results In total, 41 trials (4999 participants) met the inclusion criteria of this review. In this update, we added four trials to the 37 trials included in the first published review version. Thirty trials were published over 20 years ago. Only one trial used adequate methods of randomization and allocation concealment, was blinded, and analysed all randomized participants. Only one trial used an  E histolytica  stool antigen test, and two trials used amoebic culture. Tinidazole may be more effective than metronidazole for reducing clinical failure (RR 0.28, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.51; 477 participants, eight trials; low‐certainty evidence) and is probably associated with fewer adverse events (RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.46 to 0.92; 477 participants, 8 trials; moderate‐certainty evidence). Compared with metronidazole, combination therapy may result in fewer parasitological failures (RR 0.36, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.86; 720 participants, 3 trials; low‐certainty evidence), but we are uncertain which combination is more effective than another. Evidence is insufficient to allow conclusions regarding the efficacy of other antiamoebic drugs. Authors' conclusions Compared with metronidazole, tinidazole may be more effective in reducing clinical failure and may be associated with fewer adverse events. Combination drug therapy may be more effective for reducing parasitological failure compared with metronidazole alone. However, these results are based mostly on small trials conducted over 20 years ago with a variety of poorly defined outcomes. Tests that detect  E histolytica  more accurately are needed, particularly in countries where concomitant infection with other bacteria and parasites is common. Plain language summary Antiamoebic drugs for treating amoebic colitis What is the aim of this review? This Cochrane Review aims to determine the effectiveness and safety of drugs used to treat people with amoebic colitis, which is an infection of the large intestines caused by the parasite,  Entamoeba histolytica . Cochrane researchers searched for all relevant studies to answer this question and included 41 relevant studies in this review. Key messages Tinidazole may be more effective than metronidazole for reducing clinical symptoms and may be associated with fewer adverse events. Combination therapy resulted in fewer parasitological failures than occurred with metronidazole alone. Evidence is insufficient to allow conclusions regarding the efficacy of other antiamoebic drugs. Better quality randomized trials using accurate diagnostic methods and standardized outcomes are needed to evaluate the efficacy of drugs for treating individuals with amoebic colitis. What was studied in the review? Entamoeba histolytica  is distributed throughout the world and is commonly acquired by ingestion of contaminated food or water. An estimated 40 to 50 million people infected with  E histolytica  develop amoebic colitis or extraintestinal abscesses, resulting in up to 100,000 deaths per year. Metronidazole is currently the standard therapy for treating adults and children with invasive amoebiasis, but it may not be sufficient to eliminate amoebic cysts from the intestine. Some unpleasant adverse effects have been associated with metronidazole, and the possibility of parasite resistance to metronidazole has led to the development of alternative drugs. Combinations of metronidazole with other drugs that eradicate surviving cysts in the intestines have been recommended, so evidence to support this approach needs to be assessed. This review compares different drugs used against amoebic colitis, alone or in combination, and also assesses single‐dose regimens versus longer regimens. What are the main results of the review? This review included 41 studies, most of which were conducted in countries considered to be highly endemic for amoebiasis. Most trials were old: 30 were conducted before 1998. Trials varied in the inclusion criteria used to enrol participants and in the definition and timing of measured outcomes. Stool microscopy with direct wet saline smear was the method used most often to detect the presence of  E histolytica  in stools. Study participants ranged in age from seven months to 80 years. Included trials reported a variety of comparisons and involved 25 individual drugs, two herbal products, and 15 different combinations. The review shows that in individuals with amoebic colitis, tinidazole may be better for reducing clinical symptoms (low‐certainty evidence) and probably results in fewer adverse events when compared with metronidazole (moderate‐certainty evidence). However, we do not know whether it is more effective for eradicating amoebae from the stools. Combination drug therapy may be more effective than metronidazole alone for eradicating amoebae (low‐certainty evidence), but we are uncertain which drug combination is most effective, and if combination treatment will lead to more rapid resolution of clinical symptoms or in more adverse events (very low‐certainty evidence). Evidence is insufficient to allow conclusions regarding efficacy of the other antiamoebic drugs. How up‐to‐date is this review?   The review authors searched for studies that had been published up to 22 March 2018.},

abstract = {Abstract - Background The effectiveness of injection therapy for low‐back pain is still debatable. Heterogeneity of target tissue, pharmacological agent and dosage generally found in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) points to the need for clinically valid comparisons in a literature synthesis. Objectives To determine if injection therapy is more effective than placebo or other treatments for patients with subacute or chronic low‐back pain. Search methods We updated the search of the earlier systematic review and searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE and EMBASE databases from January 1999 to March 2007 for relevant trials reported in English, French, German, Dutch and Nordic languages. We also screened references from trials identified. Selection criteria RCTs on the effects of injection therapy involving epidural, facet or local sites for subacute or chronic low‐back pain were included. Studies which compared the effects of intradiscal injections, prolotherapy or Ozone therapy with other treatments, were excluded unless injection therapy with another pharmaceutical agent (no placebo treatment) was part of one of the treatment arms. Studies about injections in sacroiliac joints and studies evaluating the effects of epidural steroids for radicular pain were also excluded. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently assessed the quality of the trials. If study data were clinically and statistically too heterogeneous to perform a meta‐analysis, we used a best evidence synthesis to summarize the results. The evidence was classified into five levels (strong, moderate, limited, conflicting or no evidence), taking into account the methodological quality of the studies. Main results 18 trials (1179 participants) were included in this updated review. The injection sites varied from epidural sites and facet joints (i.e. intra‐articular injections, peri‐articular injections and nerve blocks) to local sites (i.e. tender‐ and trigger points). The drugs that were studied consisted of corticosteroids, local anesthetics and a variety of other drugs. The methodological quality of the trials was limited with 10 out of 18 trials rated as having a high methodological quality. Statistical pooling was not possible due to clinical heterogeneity in the trials. Overall, the results indicated that there is no strong evidence for or against the use of any type of injection therapy. Authors' conclusions There is insufficient evidence to support the use of injection therapy in subacute and chronic low‐back pain. However, it cannot be ruled out that specific subgroups of patients may respond to a specific type of injection therapy. Plain language summary Injection therapy for subacute and chronic low‐back pain Injection therapy is one of many treatments available for patients with subacute (longer than six weeks) and chronic (longer than 12 weeks) low‐back pain. Where the injection is given, what drug is used and why the injection is given can all vary. The injection can be given into different parts of the spine (the space between the vertebrae, around the nerve roots, or into the disc), ligaments, muscles or trigger points (spots in the muscles that when pressed firmly will produce pain). Drugs that reduce swelling (corticosteroids, non‐steroidal anti‐inflammatory (NSAIDs)) and pain (morphine, anaesthetics) are used. Injection therapy can be used for individuals with low‐back pain with or without pain and other symptoms in the leg. A number of electronic databases of healthcare articles were searched up to March 2007. This search identified 18 randomized controlled trials (RCTs; 1179 participants) that looked at injections with a variety of drugs compared to a placebo drug or other drugs. The injections were given into the epidural space (between the vertebrae of the back and outside the coverings that surround the spinal cord), the facet joints (the joints of two vertebrae), or tender spots in the ligaments or muscles. The review authors rated ten of the 18 RCTs as having a low risk of bias in the way the trials were conducted and reported. They were unable to statistically pool the results because the injection sites, drugs used and outcomes measured were too varied. Only five of the 18 trials reported significant results in favour of one of the treatment arms. The reviewer authors considered the likely treatment benefits to be worth the potential harms in only two studies.   In nine out of the 18 studies, side effects such as headache, dizziness, transient local pain, tingling and numbness and nausea were reported in small numbers of patients. The use of morphine was more frequently associated with itching, nausea and vomiting. Rare but more serious complications of injection therapy have been mentioned in the literature, such as cauda equina syndrome, septic facet joint arthritis, discitis, paraplegia, paraspinal abscesses. Although the absolute frequency of these complications may be rare, these risks should be taken into consideration.     Based on these results, the review authors concluded that there is no strong evidence for or against the use of any type of injection therapy for individuals with subacute or chronic low‐back pain.},

abstract = {Abstract - Background A septic abortion refers to any abortion (spontaneous or induced) complicated by upper genital tract infection including endometritis or parametritis. The mainstay of treatment of septic abortion is antibiotic therapy alone or in combination with evacuation of retained products of conception. Regimens including broad‐spectrum antibiotics are routinely recommended for treatment. However, there is no consensus on the most effective antibiotics alone or in combination to treat septic abortion. This review aimed to bridge this gap in knowledge to inform policy and practice. Objectives To review the effectiveness of various individual antibiotics or antibiotic regimens in the treatment of septic abortion. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, LILACS, and POPLINE using the following keywords: 'Abortion', 'septic abortion', 'Antibiotics', 'Infected abortion', 'postabortion infection'. We also searched the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP) and ClinicalTrials.gov for ongoing trials on 19 April, 2016. Selection criteria We considered for inclusion randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and non‐RCTs that compared antibiotic(s) to another antibiotic(s), irrespective of route of administration, dosage, and duration as well as studies comparing antibiotics alone with antibiotics in combination with other interventions such as dilation and curettage (D&C). Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently extracted data from included trials. We resolved disagreements through consultation with a third author. One review author entered extracted data into Review Manager 5.3, and a second review author cross‐checked the entry for accuracy. Main results We included 3 small RCTs involving 233 women that were conducted over 3 decades ago. Clindamycin did not differ significantly from penicillin plus chloramphenicol in reducing fever in all women (mean difference (MD) ‐12.30, 95% confidence interval (CI) ‐25.12 to 0.52; women = 77; studies = 1). The evidence for this was of moderate quality. "Response to treatment was evaluated by the patient's 'fever index' expressed in degree‐hour and defined as the total quantity of fever under the daily temperature curve with 99°F (37.2°C) as the baseline". There was no difference in duration of hospitalisation between clindamycin and penicillin plus chloramphenicol. The mean duration of hospital stay for women in each group was 5 days (MD 0.00, 95% CI ‐0.54 to 0.54; women = 77; studies = 1). One study evaluated the effect of penicillin plus chloramphenicol versus cephalothin plus kanamycin before and after D&C. Response to therapy was evaluated by "the time from start of antibiotics until fever lysis and time from D&C until patients become afebrile". Low‐quality evidence suggested that the effect of penicillin plus chloramphenicol on fever did not differ from that of cephalothin plus kanamycin (MD ‐2.30, 95% CI ‐17.31 to 12.71; women = 56; studies = 1). There was no significant difference between penicillin plus chloramphenicol versus cephalothin plus kanamycin when D&C was performed during antibiotic therapy (MD ‐1.00, 95% CI ‐13.84 to 11.84; women = 56; studies = 1). The quality of evidence was low. A study with unclear risk of bias showed that the time for fever resolution (MD ‐5.03, 95% CI ‐5.77 to ‐4.29; women = 100; studies = 1) as well as time for resolution of leukocytosis (MD ‐4.88, 95% CI ‐5.98 to ‐3.78; women = 100; studies = 1) was significantly lower with tetracycline plus enzymes compared with intravenous penicillin G. Treatment failure and adverse events occurred infrequently, and the difference between groups was not statistically significant. Authors' conclusions We found no strong evidence that intravenous clindamycin alone was better than penicillin plus chloramphenicol for treating women with septic abortion. Similarly, available evidence did not suggest that penicillin plus chloramphenicol was better than cephalothin plus kanamycin for the treatment of women with septic abortion. Tetracyline enzyme antibiotic appeared to be more effective than intravenous penicillin G in reducing the time to fever defervescence, but this evidence was provided by only one study at low risk of bias. There is a need for high‐quality RCTs providing reliable evidence for treatments of septic abortion with antibiotics that are currently in use. The three included studies were carried out over 30 years ago. There is also a need to include institutions in low‐resource settings, such as sub‐Saharan Africa, Latin America and the Caribbean, and South Asia, with a high burden of abortion and health systems challenges. Plain language summary Antibiotics for treating septic abortion Background A septic abortion is any abortion with infection after a miscarriage or intentional pregnancy termination. One of the signs of septic abortion is fever. Antibiotic treatment is very important for the treatment of septic abortion. The recommended treatments include antibiotics that have effects on different types of bacteria. However, there is no agreement on the most effective antibiotics to be used either alone or in combination to treat septic abortion. Trial characteristics This review included 3 small studies of 233 women with septic abortion. One study compared clindamycin alone to penicillin plus chloramphenicol; the second study compared penicillin plus chloramphenicol to cephalothin plus kanamycin; and the third study compared tetracycline enzyme‐based antibiotic with intravenous penicillin G. Results We found no strong evidence that clindamycin alone is better than penicillin plus chloramphenicol for treating women with septic abortion. Similarly, the available evidence did not suggest that penicillin plus chloramphenicol is better than cephalothin plus kanamycin for the treatment of women with septic abortion. Furthermore, performing D&C before starting antibiotic treatment was not better than performing D&C after antibiotic treatment has begun. The use of tetracycline‐enzyme antibiotic brought women's fever down faster than intravenous penicillin G. Conclusion The available evidence from three small trials, which involved some antibiotics not currently in use, is insufficient to advocate for a change in existing treatment recommendations for septic abortion. In spite of this, combinations of antibiotics may be administered to women with septic abortion because they are more likely to reduce fever faster, including in women with bacteria in the blood, than single antibiotic treatment. Only one study reported harm experienced by women: two women given clindamycin had treatment failure, and one woman had an adverse drug reaction. In addition, two women in the clindamycin group had pelvic abscess compared to one in the penicillin plus chloramphenicol group, although the difference was not significant. The limitation of this review is the inclusion of three small studies conducted over 30 years ago.},

abstract = {Abstract - Background Postpartum endometritis occurs when vaginal organisms invade the endometrial cavity during the labor process and cause infection. This is more common following cesarean birth. The condition warrants antibiotic treatment. Objectives Systematically, to review treatment failure and other complications of different antibiotic regimens for postpartum endometritis. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (30 November 2014) and reference lists of retrieved studies. Selection criteria We included randomized trials of different antibiotic regimens after cesarean birth or vaginal birth; no quasi‐randomized trials were included. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and risk of bias, extracted data and checked them for accuracy. Main results The review includes a total of 42 trials, and 40 of these trials contributed data on 4240 participants. Twenty studies, involving 1918 women, compared clindamycin plus an aminoglycoside (gentamicin for all studies except for one that used tobramycin) with another regimen. When assessing the individual subgroups of other antibiotic regimens (i.e. cephalosporins, monobactams, penicillins, and quinolones), there were fewer treatment failures in those treated with clindamycin plus an aminoglycoside as compared to those treated with cephalosporins (RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.49 to 0.99; participants = 872; studies = 8;  low quality evidence ) or penicillins (RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.46 to 0.90; participants = 689; studies = 7,  low quality evidence ). For the remaining subgroups for the primary analysis, the differences were not significant. There were significantly fewer wound infections in those treated with clindamycin plus aminoglycoside versus cephalosporins (RR 0.53, 95% CI 0.30 to 0.93; participants = 500; studies = 4;  low quality evidence ). Similarly, there were more treatment failures in those treated with an gentamicin/penicillin when compared to those treated with gentamIcin/clindamycin (RR 2.57, 95% CI 1.48 to 4.46; participants = 200; studies = 1). There were fewer treatment failures when an agent with a longer half‐life that is administered less frequently was used (RR 0.61, 95% CI 0.40 to 0.92; participants = 484; studies = 2) as compared to using cefoxitin. There were more treatment failures (RR 1.94, 95% CI 1.38 to 2.72; participants = 774; studies = 7) and wound infections (RR 1.88, 95% CI 1.17 to 3.02; participants = 740; studies = 6) in those treated with a regimen with poor activity against penicillin‐resistant anaerobic bacteria as compared to those treated with a regimen with good activity against penicillin‐resistant anaerobic bacteria. Once‐daily dosing was associated with a shorter length of hospital stay (MD ‐0.73, 95% CI ‐1.27 to ‐0.20; participants = 322; studies = 3). There were no differences between groups with respect to severe complications and no trials reported any maternal deaths. Regarding the secondary outcomes, three studies that compared continued oral antibiotic therapy after intravenous therapy with no oral therapy, found no differences in recurrent endometritis or other outcomes. There were no differences between groups for the outcomes of allergic reactions. The overall risk of bias was unclear in the most of the studies. The quality of the evidence using GRADE comparing clindamycin and an aminoglycoside with another regimen (compared with cephalosporins or penicillins) was low to very low for therapeutic failure, severe complications, wound infection and allergic reaction. Authors' conclusions The combination of clindamycin and gentamicin is appropriate for the treatment of endometritis. Regimens with good activity against penicillin‐resistant anaerobic bacteria are better than those with poor activity against penicillin‐resistant anaerobic bacteria. There is no evidence that any one regimen is associated with fewer side‐effects. Following clinical improvement of uncomplicated endometritis which has been treated with intravenous therapy, the use of additional oral therapy has not been proven to be beneficial. Plain language summary Antibiotic regimens for postpartum endometritis Intravenous clindamycin plus gentamicin is more effective than other antibiotics or combinations of antibiotics for treatment of womb infection after childbirth. Inflammation of the lining of the womb (endometritis) can be caused by vaginal bacteria entering the womb (uterus) during childbirth and causing infection within six weeks of the birth (postpartum endometritis). Postpartum endometritis occurs after about 1% to 3% of vaginal births, and up to 27% of cesarean births. Prolonged rupture of the membranes (breaking the bag of water that surrounds the baby) and multiple vaginal examinations during birth also appear to increase the risk. Endometritis causes fever, tenderness in the pelvic region and unpleasant‐smelling vaginal discharge after the birth. It can have serious complications such as the formation of pelvic abscesses, blood clots, infection of the thin layer of tissue that covers the inside of the abdomen and abdominal organs (peritonitis), and whole body inflammation (sepsis). It is also an important cause of maternal deaths worldwide, although with the use of antibiotics, this is very rare in high‐income countries. There are many antibiotic treatments currently in use. This review compared different antibiotics, routes of administration and dosages for endometritis. The review identified 42 relevant randomised controlled studies, which are the most reliable type of medical trial for this type of investigation; 40 of these (involving 4240 women) contributed data for analysis. The results showed that the combination of intravenous gentamicin and clindamycin, and drugs with a broad range of activity against the relevant penicillin‐resistant bacterial strains, are the most effective for treating endometritis after childbirth. Women treated with clindamycin plus an aminoglycoside (gentamicin) showed fewer treatment failures than those treated with penicillin, but this difference was not evident when women treated with clindamycin plus an aminoglycoside were compared to women who received other antibiotic treatments. There were more treatment failures in women treated with an penicillin plus gentamicin (one study) compared with those treated with clindamycin plus gentamicin. Seven trials showed that an antibiotic treatment that had poor activity against bacteria resistant to penicillin had a higher failure rate and more wound infections than an antibiotic treatment that had good activity against these bacteria. There was no evidence that any of the antibiotic combinations had fewer adverse effects ‐ including allergic reaction ‐ than other antibiotic combinations. If the endometritis was uncomplicated and improved with intravenous antibiotics, there did not appear to be a need to follow the intravenous antibiotics with a course of oral antibiotics. Overall the reliability of the studies' results was unclear, the numbers of women studied were often small and data on other outcomes were limited; furthermore, a number of the studies had been funded by drug companies that conceivably would have had a vested interest in the results.},

abstract = {Abstract - Background Patients with longstanding ulcerative colitis and colonic Crohn's disease have an increased risk of colorectal cancer (CRC) compared with the general population. This review assessed the evidence that endoscopic surveillance may prolong life by allowing earlier detection of CRC or its pre‐cursor lesion, dysplasia, in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Objectives To assess the effectiveness of cancer surveillance programs for diagnosis of IBD‐associated colorectal cancer and in reducing the mortality rate from colorectal cancer in patients with IBD. Search methods We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL and clinical clinicaltrials.gov from inception to 19 September 2016. We also searched conference abstracts and reference lists to identify additional studies. Selection criteria Potentially relevant articles were reviewed independently and unblinded by two authors to determine eligibility. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or observational studies (cohort or case control) assessing any form of endoscopic surveillance aimed at early detection of CRC were considered for inclusion. Studies had to have a no surveillance comparison group to be eligible for inclusion. Data collection and analysis Eligible studies were reviewed in duplicate and the results of the primary research trials were independently extracted by two authors. The primary outcome was detection of CRC. Secondary outcomes included death from CRC, time to cancer detection, time to death and adverse events. Deaths from CRC were derived from life tables, survival curves or where possible, by calculating life tables from the data provided. The presence of significant heterogeneity among studies was tested by the chi‐square test. Because this is a relatively insensitive test, a P value of less than 0.1 was considered statistically significant. Provided statistical heterogeneity was not present, the fixed effects model was used for the pooling of data. The 2x2 tables were combined into a summary test statistic using the pooled odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence intervals as described by Cochrane and Mantel and Haenszel. The methodological quality of the included studies was assessed using the Newcastle‐Ottawa scale for non‐randomised studies The overall quality of the evidence supporting the primary and selected secondary outcomes was assessed using the GRADE criteria. Main results No RCTs were identified. Five observational studies (N = 7199) met the inclusion criteria. The studies scored well on the Newcastle‐Ottawa scale, but due to the nature of observational studies, a high risk of bias was assigned to all the studies. Three studies were pooled to assess the rate of cancer detected in the surveillance group compared to the non‐surveillance group. The studies found a significantly higher rate of cancer detection in the non surveillance group compared to the surveillance group. CRC was detected in 1.83% (53/2895) of patients in the surveillance group compared to 3.17% (135/4256) of patients in the non‐surveillance group (OR 0.58, 95% CI 0.42 to 0.80; P = 0.0009). Four studies were pooled to assess the death rate associated with CRC in patients who underwent surveillance compared to patients who did not undergo surveillance. There was a significantly lower death rate associated with CRC in the surveillance group compared to the non‐surveillance group. Eight per cent (15/176) of patients in the surveillance group died from CRC compared to 22% (79/354) of patients in the non‐surveillance group (OR 0.36, 95% CI 0.19 to 0.69, P=0.002). Data were pooled from two studies to examine the rate of early stage versus late stage colorectal cancer (Duke stages A & B compared to Duke stages C & D) in patients who underwent surveillance compared to patients who do not undergo surveillance. A significantly higher rate of early stage CRC (Duke A & B) was detected in the surveillance group compared to the non‐surveillance group. Sixteen per cent (17/110) of patients in the surveillance group had early stage CRC compared to 8% (9/117) of patients in the non‐surveillance group (OR 5.40, 95% CI 1.51 to 19.30; P = 0.009). A higher rate of late stage CRC (Duke C & D) was observed in the non‐surveillance group compared to the surveillance group. Nine per cent (10/110) of patients in the surveillance group had late stage CRC compared to 16% (19/117) of patients in the non‐surveillance group (OR 0.46, 95% CI 0.08 to 2.51; P = 0.37). A GRADE analysis indicated that the quality of the data was very low for all of these outcomes. The included studies did not report on the other pre‐specified outcomes including time to cancer detection, time to death and adverse events. Authors' conclusions The current data suggest that colonoscopic surveillance in IBD may reduce the development of both CRC and the rate of CRC‐associated death through early detection, although the quality of the evidence is very low. The detection of earlier stage CRC in the surveillance group may explain some of the survival benefit observed. RCTs assessing the efficacy of endoscopic surveillance in people with IBD are unlikely to be undertaken due to ethical considerations. Plain language summary Strategies for detecting colon cancer in patients with inflammatory bowel disease What is inflammatory bowel disease? Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is composed of two main disorders Crohn’s disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). These diseases are chronic inflammatory disorder of the gastrointestinal tract. Common symptoms may include abdominal pain, cramping, diarrhoea, and blood in stools. People with CD may also experience intestinal strictures (a narrowing of a section of the intestine that causes problems by slowing or blocking the movement of food), abscesses (a collection of pus that has built up within the tissue) and fistulae (an abnormal channel or passageway connecting one internal organ to another, or to the outside surface of the body). What is colon cancer? Long term inflammation associated with IBD leads to an increased risk of colon cancer compared to the risk in people without IBD. Colon cancer is a malignant tumour arising from the inner wall of the large intestine (the colon). What is endoscopic surveillance? An endoscopy is a non‐surgical procedure used to view the digestive tract using a camera. The doctor who performs the endoscopy can take tissue samples of suspicious lesions or growths during the procedure. Endoscopic surveillance is used to identify pre‐cancerous growths (called dysplasia) or colon cancer in patients with IBD. Endoscopy may help to identify colon cancer at an earlier stage and help prolong survival and lower the death rate due to colon cancer What did the researchers investigate? The researchers reviewed published studies comparing people with IBD who had endoscopic surveillance to people who did not have endoscopic surveillance to see whether surveillance provided any benefit in terms of diagnosing colon cancer at an earlier stage or reducing the death rate due to colon cancer. The medical literature was searched and analysed up to 19 September 2016. What did the researchers find? Five observational studies with 7199 patients were used to compare endoscopic surveillance to non‐surveillance. The key findings of the review were that a higher rate of cancer occurred in the non‐surveillance group compared to the surveillance group, and that a lower rate of colon cancer‐associated death was demonstrated in the surveillance group compared to the non‐surveillance group. In patients undergoing surveillance, the odds of colon cancer development were reduced by 42% and the odds of death associated with colon cancer was reduced by 64%. Surveillance resulted in detection of a higher rate of early stage colorectal cancer in the surveillance group compared to the non surveillance group which may explain the improved survival seen with surveillance. The overall quality of the evidence is very low due to the nature of observation studies and the low number of events. Nonetheless, these results suggest that endoscopic surveillance in people with IBD may reduce the development of colon cancer through early detection and may also reduce the chances of dying from colon cancer.},

abstract = {Abstract - Background Chorioamnionitis is a common infection that affects both mother and infant. Infant complications associated with chorioamnionitis include early neonatal sepsis, pneumonia, and meningitis. Chorioamnionitis can also result in maternal morbidity such as pelvic infection and septic shock. Clinical chorioamnionitis is estimated to occur in 1% to 2% of term births and in 5% to 10% of preterm births; histologic chorioamnionitis is found in nearly 20% of term births and in 50% of preterm births. Women with chorioamnionitis have a two to three times higher risk for cesarean delivery and a three to four times greater risk for endomyometritis, wound infection, pelvic abscess, bacteremia, and postpartum hemorrhage. Objectives To assess the effects of administering antibiotic regimens for intra‐amniotic infection on maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality and on infection‐related complications. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (1 October 2014), CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS, and the WHO  ICTRP  (September 2014). We also searched reference lists of retrieved studies and contacted experts in the field. Selection criteria Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that included women who experienced intra‐amniotic infection. Trials were included if they compared antibiotic treatment with placebo or no treatment (if applicable), treatment with different antibiotic regimens, or timing of antibiotic therapy (intrapartum and/or postpartum). Therefore, this review assesses trials evaluating intrapartum antibiotics, intrapartum and postpartum antibiotic regimens, and postpartum antibiotics. Diagnosis of intra‐amniotic infection was based on standard criteria (clinical/test), and no limit was placed on gestational age. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and trial quality. Two review authors independently extracted data and checked them for accuracy. We assessed the quality of the evidence using the Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach and included a 'Summary of findings' table. Main results Our prespecified primary outcomes were maternal and neonatal mortality, maternal and neonatal severe infection, and duration of maternal and neonatal hospital stay. We included 11 studies (involving 1296 women) and assessed them as having low to moderate risk of bias ‐ mainly because allocation concealment methods were not adequately reported, most studies were open, and outcome reporting was incomplete. The quality of the evidence was low to very low for most outcomes, as per the GRADE approach. The following antibiotics were assessed in the included trials: ampicillin, ampicillin/sulbactam, gentamicin, clindamycin, and cefotetan. During labor:  meta‐analysis of two studies found no clear differences in rates of neonatal sepsis (163 neonates; risk ratio (RR) 1.07, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.40 to 2.86; I² = 9%; low quality of evidence), treatment failure (endometritis) (163 participants; RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.27 to 2.70; I² = 0%; low quality of evidence), and postpartum hemorrhage (RR 1.39, 95% CI 0.76 to 2.56; I² = 0%; low quality of evidence) when two different dosages/regimens of gentamicin were assessed. No clear differences between groups were found for any reported maternal or neonatal outcomes. The review did not identify data for a comparison of antibiotics versus no treatment/placebo. Postpartum : meta‐analysis of two studies that evaluated use of antibiotics versus placebo after vaginal delivery showed no significant differences between groups in rates of treatment failure or postpartum endometritis. No significant differences were found in rates of neonatal death and postpartum endometritis when use of antibiotics was compared with no treatment. Four trials assessing two different dosages/regimens of gentamicin or dual‐agent therapy versus triple‐agent therapy, or comparing antibiotics, found no significant differences in most reported neonatal or maternal outcomes; the duration of hospital stay showed a difference in favor of the group of women who received short‐duration antibiotics (one study, 292 women; mean difference (MD) ‐0.90 days, 95% CI ‐1.64 to ‐0.16; moderate quality of evidence). Intrapartum versus postpartum: o ne small study (45 women) evaluating use of ampicillin/gentamicin during intrapartum versus immediate postpartum treatment found significant differences favoring the intrapartum group in the mean number of days of maternal postpartum hospital stay (one trial, 45 women; MD ‐1.00 days, 95% CI ‐1.94 to ‐ 0.06; very low quality of evidence) and the mean number of neonatal hospital stay days (one trial, 45 neonates; MD ‐1.90 days, 95% CI ‐3.91 to ‐0.49; very low quality of evidence). Although no significant differences were found in the rate of maternal bacteremia or early neonatal sepsis, for the outcome of neonatal pneumonia or sepsis we observed a significant difference favoring intrapartum treatment (one trial, 45 neonates; RR 0.06, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.95; very low quality of evidence). Authors' conclusions This review included 11 studies (having low to moderate risk of bias). The quality of the evidence was low to very low for most outcomes, as per the GRADE approach. Only one outcome (duration of hospital stay) was considered to provide moderate quality of evidence when antibiotics (short duration) were compared with antibiotics (long duration) during postpartum management of intra‐amniotic infection. Our main reasons for downgrading the quality of evidence were limitations in study design or execution (risk of bias), imprecision, and inconsistency of results. Currently, limited evidence is available to reveal the most appropriate antimicrobial regimen for the treatment of patients with intra‐amniotic infection; whether antibiotics should be continued during the postpartum period; and which antibiotic regimen or what treatment duration should be used. Also, no evidence was found on adverse effects of the intervention (not reported in any of the included studies). One small RCT showed that use of antibiotics during the intrapartum period is superior to their use during the postpartum period in reducing the number of days of maternal and neonatal hospital stay. Plain language summary Using antibiotics to treat intra‐amniotic infection in pregnant women Review question:  Cochrane authors reviewed available evidence from randomized controlled trials on the use of antibiotics for the treatment of pregnant women with intra‐amniotic infection (chorioamnionitis). Background:  chorioamnionitis is a common occurrence among pregnant women that affects both mother and baby and usually results in referral to hospital. It is an infection of the fetal membranes, amniotic fluid, and placenta that can cause complications for the newborn infant including whole body inflammation or sepsis, pneumonia, and meningitis. Chorioamnionitis can also result in health issues for the mother such as pelvic infection, sepsis, postpartum hemorrhage, and increased risk for cesarean delivery of the infant. Risk factors for developing chorioamnionitis include active labor for a long time, extended duration of rupture of membranes and internal monitoring, meconium staining of amniotic fluid, and a large number of digital vaginal examinations. Treatment for patients with intra‐amniotic infection usually consists of antibiotics that can be administered during birth or immediately afterward. Currently, information is insufficient to suggest the most appropriate treatment regimen, which antibiotic regimen should be used, and whether antibiotics should be continued during the period immediately following birth and for what duration. Study characteristics:  a total of 11 studies were identified with 1296 women; most studies were conducted in the USA. Four studies evaluated the use of antibiotics before the birth (antepartum); six studies evaluated the use of antibiotics after birth (postpartum); and one compared antibiotic administration both before and after birth. Quality of the evidence:  the quality of the evidence was ranked low to very low, mainly because many studies had methodological limitations with outcome results based on limited numbers of trials and included participants that could be pooled. Key results:  based on the findings of one study, treatment during labor was found to be more effective than treatment after labor; however this finding relates only to maternal and neonatal length of hospital stay and to neonatal severe infection. No evidence indicated that a higher dose of antibiotics before birth was superior to a lower dose. Immediately following birth, no evidence showed that different types of antibiotics or longer or shorter treatment duration improved the health of the mother and her newborn. All women who participated in the postpartum trials received antibiotics before the time of birth. Therefore insufficient information was available from randomized controlled trials to reveal the most appropriate regimen of antibiotics for the treatment of patients with intra‐amniotic infection, whether antibiotics should be continued during the postpartum period, and which antibiotic regimen should be used and for what duration. None of the included studies reported information related to adverse effects of the intervention.},

We placed no restrictions regarding language and publication date. We handsearched the reference lists of the studies retrieved and key journals in the field of endodontics. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) involving people with periapical pathosis. Studies could compare surgery versus non‐surgical treatment or could compare different types of surgery. Outcome measures were healing of the periapical lesion assessed after one‐year follow‐up or longer; postoperative pain and discomfort; and adverse effects such as tooth loss, mobility, soft tissue recession, abscess, infection, neurological damage or loss of root sealing material evaluated through radiographs. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently extracted data from included studies and assessed their risk of bias. We contacted study authors to obtain missing information. We combined results of trials assessing comparable outcomes using the fixed‐effect model, with risk ratios (RRs) for dichotomous outcomes and mean differences (MDs) for continuous outcomes, and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We used generic inverse variance for split‐mouth studies. Main results We included 20 RCTs. Two trials at high risk of bias assessed surgery versus a non‐surgical approach: root‐end resection with root‐end filling versus root canal retreatment. The other 18 trials evaluated different surgical protocols: cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) versus periapical radiography for preoperative assessment (one study at high risk of bias); antibiotic prophylaxis versus placebo (one study at unclear risk); different magnification devices (loupes, surgical microscope, endoscope) (two studies at high risk); types of incision (papilla base incision, sulcular incision) (one study at high risk and one at unclear risk); ultrasonic devices versus handpiece burs (one study at high risk); types of root‐end filling material (glass ionomer cement, amalgam, intermediate restorative material (IRM), mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA), gutta‐percha (GP), super‐ethoxy benzoic acid (EBA)) (five studies at high risk of bias, one at unclear risk and one at low risk); grafting versus no grafting (three studies at high risk and one at unclear risk); and low energy level laser therapy versus placebo (irradiation without laser activation) versus control (no use of the laser device) (one study at high risk). There was no clear evidence of superiority of the surgical or non‐surgical approach for healing at one‐year follow‐up (RR 1.15, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.35; two RCTs, 126 participants) or at four‐ or 10‐year follow‐up (one RCT, 82 to 95 participants), although the evidence is very low quality. More participants in the surgically treated group reported pain in the first week after treatment (RR 3.34, 95% CI 2.05 to 5.43; one RCT, 87 participants; low quality evidence). In terms of surgical protocols, there was some inconclusive evidence that ultrasonic devices for root‐end preparation may improve healing one year after retreatment, when compared with the traditional bur (RR 1.14, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.30; one RCT, 290 participants; low quality evidence). There was evidence of better healing when root‐ends were filled with MTA than when they were treated by smoothing of orthograde GP root filling, after one‐year follow‐up (RR 1.60, 95% CI 1.14 to 2.24; one RCT, 46 participants; low quality evidence). There was no evidence that using CBCT rather than radiography for preoperative evaluation was advantageous for healing (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.47; one RCT, 39 participants; very low quality evidence), nor that any magnification device affected healing more than any other (loupes versus endoscope at one year: RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.20; microscope versus endoscope at two years: RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.15; one RCT, 70 participants, low quality evidence). There was no evidence that antibiotic prophylaxis reduced incidence of postoperative infection (RR 0.49, 95% CI 0.09 to 2.64; one RCT, 250 participants; low quality evidence). There was some evidence that using a papilla base incision (PBI) may be beneficial for preservation of the interdental papilla compared with complete papilla mobilisation (one RCT (split‐mouth), 12 participants/24 sites; very low quality evidence). There was no evidence of less pain in the PBI group at day 1 post surgery (one RCT, 38 participants; very low quality evidence). There was evidence that adjunctive use of a gel of plasma rich in growth factors reduced postoperative pain compared with no grafting (measured on visual analogue scale: one day postoperative MD ‐51.60 mm, 95% CI ‐63.43 to ‐39.77; one RCT, 36 participants; low quality evidence). There was no evidence that use of low energy level laser therapy (LLLT) prevented postoperative pain (very low quality evidence). Authors' conclusions Available evidence does not provide clinicians with reliable guidelines for treating periapical lesions. Further research is necessary to understand the effects of surgical versus non‐surgical approaches, and to determine which surgical procedures provide the best results for periapical lesion healing and postoperative quality of life. Future studies should use standardised techniques and success criteria, precisely defined outcomes and the participant as the unit of analysis. Plain language summary Procedures for retreatment of failed root canal therapy Review question We aimed to find out the best way to retreat patients for whom root canal therapy has failed. We wanted to know whether surgical or non‐surgical retreatment was better, and if using specific materials, devices or procedures in surgery might improve healing of the lesion or reduce patient discomfort after surgery. This review updates one published in 2008. Background In root canal therapy, the infected pulp of a tooth is removed, and the root cavity is disinfected and filled with a sealing material. However, if micro‐organisms that caused the infection are not completely removed, after some time they may cause a disease at the tip of the root, called a periapical lesion. Treatment for this requires a second intervention, which can be performed in the same way as the first treatment, from the crown into the root canal, to remove the existing filler and clean and disinfect as well as possible before sealing again. Alternatively, should this procedure fail, or if it is not feasible, a surgical intervention can be used. Study characteristics We conducted a wide search of medical and dental literature up to 10 February 2016. We identified 20 studies that randomised participants to groups receiving different forms of retreatment of periapical lesions. These studies evaluated nine different comparisons: surgical versus non‐surgical treatment (two studies, one monitoring participants for up to 10 years); two diagnostic radiographic techniques (one study); the occurrence of postoperative infection with or without antibiotics (one study); use of different devices for enhancing the surgeon's view during the most critical steps of the surgical procedure (one study); the aesthetic appearance of the gum next to the treated tooth and pain after operation when two different types of gingival incision were used (two studies); use of minimally invasive ultrasonic devices or traditional rotating burs to manage the tip of the root (one study); use of different materials for filling the root‐end (seven studies); filling of the periapical lesion with a grafting material (four studies); and exposure of the surgical site to a low energy level laser to reduce pain (one study). Key results There is no evidence that a surgical approach leads to better results compared with non‐surgical retreatment at one year (or at four or 10 years) after intervention. However, people treated surgically reported more pain and swelling during the first week after treatment. Different surgical techniques were evaluated. Healing at one‐year follow‐up seemed to be improved by use of ultrasonic devices, instead of the traditional bur, for root‐end preparation. There was some evidence of better healing at one‐year follow‐up when root‐ends were filled with mineral trioxide aggregate compared with their being treated by smoothing of orthograde gutta percha root filling. Use of a graft composed of a gel enriched with the patient's own platelets applied to the defect during the surgical procedure significantly reduced postoperative pain. Exposure to a low energy level laser did not apparently reduce pain at the surgical site. A small gingival incision may preserve the gum between two adjacent teeth, improving the aesthetic appearance and causing less pain after surgery. There was no evidence that use of antibiotics reduces the occurrence of postoperative infection (although when the procedure is done well, infection is an extremely rare event). Different ways of enhancing the surgeon's view did not lead to different results at least one year after operation, and results of retreatment were independent of the radiographic technique used to make the diagnosis. Quality of the evidence We judged the quality of the evidence to be poor; therefore we cannot rely on the findings. Only one study was at low risk of bias;we judged the majority to be at high risk of bias. Author conclusions It is difficult to draw conclusions, as the evidence currently available is of low to very low quality. More randomised controlled trials conducted to high standards are needed to find out the effects of the surgical versus non‐surgical approach and, when surgery is used, which materials, devices or operative protocols are best for improving lesion healing and reducing patient discomfort.},

abstract = {Abstract - Background Spine surgery may be associated with severe acute postoperative pain. Compared with systemic analgesia alone, epidural analgesia may offer better pain control. However, epidural analgesia has sometimes been associated with rare but serious complications. Therefore, it is critical to quantify the real benefits of epidural analgesia over other modes of pain treatment. Objectives To assess the effectiveness and safety of epidural analgesia compared with systemic analgesia for acute postoperative pain control after thoraco‐lumbar spine surgery in children. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase and Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature on 14 November 2018, together with the references lists of related reviews and retained trials, and two trials registers. Selection criteria We included all randomized controlled trials performed in children undergoing any type of thoraco‐lumbar spine surgery comparing epidural analgesia with systemic analgesia for postoperative pain. We applied no language or publication status restriction. Data collection and analysis We assessed risk of bias of included trials using the Cochrane tool. We analysed data using random‐effects models. We rated the quality of the evidence according to the GRADE scale. Main results We included 11 trials (559 participants) in the review, and seven trials (249 participants) in the analysis: 140 participants received epidural analgesia and 109 received systemic analgesia. Most studies included adolescents. Three trials included in the analysis contained some participants older than 18 years. The types of surgery were posterior spinal fusion for idiopathic scoliosis (nine trials), anterior correction for idiopathic scoliosis (one trial), or selective dorsal rhizotomy in children with cerebral palsy (one trial). The mean numbers of vertebrae operated on were between nine and 14.5 and the mean numbers of spinal levels were between three and four and a half. The length of surgery varied between three and six and a half hours. Compared with systemic analgesia, epidural analgesia reduced pain at rest at all time points. At six to eight hours, the mean pain score on a 0 to 10 scale with systemic analgesia was 3.1 (standard deviation 0.7) and with epidural analgesia was –1.32 points (95% confidence interval (CI) –1.83 to –0.82; 4 studies, 116 participants; moderate‐quality evidence). At 72 hours, the mean pain score with epidural analgesia was equivalent to a –0.8 point reduction on a 0 to 10 scale (standardized mean difference (SMD) –0.65, 95% CI –1.19 to –0.10; 5 studies, 157 participants; moderate‐quality evidence). Return of gastrointestinal function There was no difference for nausea and vomiting between groups (risk ratio (RR) 0.87, 95% CI 0.58 to 1.30; 6 studies, 215 participants; low‐quality evidence). One study found epidural analgesia with local anaesthetics may have increased the number of participants who had their first flatus within 48 hours (RR 1.63, 95% CI 1.08 to 2.47; 30 participants; very low‐quality evidence). Two studies found epidural analgesia with local anaesthetics may have increased the number of participants in whom first bowel movement occurred within 48 hours (RR 11.52, 95% CI 2.36 to 56.26; 60 participants; low‐quality evidence). It was uncertain whether epidural analgesia reduced the time to first bowel movement (MD 0.09 days, 95% CI –0.32 to 0.50; 1 study, 60 participants; very low‐quality evidence) and time to first liquid ingestion following epidural infusion of an opioid alone or a local anaesthetic plus an opioid (mean difference (MD) –5.02 hours, 95% CI –13.15 to 3.10; 2 studies, 56 participants; very low‐quality evidence). Epidural analgesia with local anaesthetics may have increased the risk of having first solid food ingestion within 48 hours (RR 7.00, 95% CI 1.91 to 25.62; 1 study, 30 participants; very low‐quality evidence). Secondary outcomes It was uncertain whether there was a difference in time to ambulate (MD 0.08 days, 95% CI –0.24 to 0.39; 1 study, 60 participants; very low‐quality evidence) and hospital length of stay (MD –0.29 days, 95% CI –0.69 to 0.10; 2 studies, 89 participants; very low‐quality evidence). Two studies found participants were more satisfied when treated with epidural analgesia (MD 1.62 on a scale from 0 to 10, 95% CI 1.26 to 1.97; 60 participants; very low‐quality evidence). It was unclear whether there was a difference in parent satisfaction for epidural analgesia with an opioid alone (MD 0.60, 95% CI –0.81 to 2.01; 1 trial, 27 participants; very low‐quality evidence). Complications It was uncertain whether there was a difference in the risk of complications such as: respiratory depression (risk difference (RD) –0.05, 95% CI –0.16 to 0.05; 4 studies, 126 participants; very low‐quality evidence); wound infection (RD 0.01, 95% CI –0.05 to 0.08; 2 trials, 93 participants; very low‐quality evidence); epidural abscess (RD 0, 95% CI –0.05 to 0.05; 3 trials, 120 participants; very low‐quality evidence); and neurological complications (RD 0.01, 95% CI –0.04 to 0.06; 4 studies, 151 participants; very low‐quality evidence). Authors' conclusions There is moderate‐ and low‐quality evidence that there may be a small additional reduction in pain up to 72 hours after surgery with epidural analgesia compared with systemic analgesia. Two very small studies showed epidural analgesia with local anaesthetic alone may accelerate the return of gastrointestinal function. The safety of this technique in children undergoing thoraco‐lumbar surgery is uncertain due to the very low‐quality of the evidence. The study in 'Studies awaiting classification' may alter the conclusions of the review once assessed. Plain language summary Epidural analgesia for postoperative pain after spinal surgery in children Review question We tried to determine if epidural analgesia offers some advantages over systemic (vein, skin or muscles) analgesia for treating postoperative pain in children undergoing spine surgery. Background Some children need extensive spinal bone surgery. This is a very painful procedure. Traditionally, this pain has mostly been treated with an opioid such as systemic morphine (or morphine like medicine) given via an in injection into the veins, skin or muscles. Epidural analgesia involves giving pain relief medicine into a catheter inserted in the spine to block pain transmission to the brain. The catheter is a small tube usually placed by the surgeon, at the end of the surgery, in the space in the spinal canal known as the epidural space. Study characteristics The evidence is current to 14 November 2018. We included 11 trials with 559 participants in the review, and seven trials with 249 participants in the analysis. The trials were funded by departmental resources (five trials), or in part by industry and partly by charity (one trial). Five trials did not mention the source of funding. Three of the trials included in the analysis contained some participants older than 18 years. Key results There may be a small additional reduction in pain up to 72 hours after surgery with epidural analgesia compared with systemic analgesia. After an extensive spine surgery, the gut is paralysed for a certain amount of time leading to nausea (feeling sick), vomiting (being sick), inability to ingest liquid or food, and no stools excretion. Two very small studies showed epidural analgesia with local anaesthetic alone may have accelerated the return of gut function. If confirmed, this would mean that children would be able to resume normal liquid and solid food intake faster after extensive spine surgery. Children in two small studies were more satisfied with epidural analgesia compared with children in the systemic analgesia group. However, it was unclear whether their parents were more satisfied with epidural analgesia or systemic analgesia. The safety of this technique in children undergoing spine surgery was uncertain because there was insufficient information to determine whether there was a difference in the rate of complications between epidural analgesia and systemic analgesia and an analysis of small trials might not be the best methodology to evaluate this aspect. Quality of the evidence The quality of evidence was moderate, low or very low for reduced pain and low or very low for all other measurements. Imperfections in the trials and low number of available trials were the main problems leading to rating the quality of evidence as low or very low.},

abstract = {Abstract - Background Crohn's disease (CD) is a chronic, relapsing and remitting disease of the gastrointestinal tract that can cause significant morbidity and disability. Current treatment guidelines recommend early intervention with immunosuppressant or biological therapy in high‐risk patients with a severe disease phenotype at presentation. The feasibility of therapeutic de‐escalation once remission is achieved is a commonly encountered question in clinical practice, driven by patient and clinician concerns regarding safety, adverse events, cost and national regulations. Withdrawal of immunosuppressant and biologic drugs in patients with quiescent CD may limit adverse events and reduce healthcare costs. Alternatively, stopping these drug therapies may result in negative outcomes such as disease relapse, drug desensitization, bowel damage and need for surgery. Objectives To assess the feasibility and safety of discontinuing immunosuppressant or biologic drugs, administered alone or in combination, in patients with quiescent CD. Search methods We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase and the Cochrane IBD Group Specialized Register from inception to 19 December 2017. We also searched the reference lists of potentially relevant manuscripts and conference proceedings to identify additional studies. Selection criteria Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and prospective cohort studies that followed patients for a minimum duration of six months after drug discontinuation were considered for inclusion. The patient population of interest was adults ( >  18 years) with CD (as defined by conventional clinical, endoscopic or histologic criteria) who had achieved remission while receiving immunosuppressant or biologic drugs administered alone or in combination. Patients then discontinued the drug regimen following a period of maintenance therapy of at least six months. The comparison was usual care (i.e. continuation of the drug regimen). Data collection and analysis The primary outcome measure was the proportion of patients who relapsed following discontinuation of immunosuppressant or biologic drugs, administered alone or in combination. Secondary outcomes included: the proportion of patients who responded to the reintroduction of immunosuppressant or biologic drugs, given as monotherapy or combination therapy; the proportion of patients who required surgery following relapse; the proportion of patients who required hospitalization for CD following relapse; the proportion of patients who developed new CD‐related complications (e.g. fistula, abscesses, strictures) following relapse; the proportion of patients with elevated biomarkers of inflammation (CRP, fecal calprotectin) in those who stop and those who continue therapy; the proportion of patients with anti‐drug antibodies and low serum trough drug levels; time to relapse; and the proportion of patients with adverse events, serious adverse events and withdrawal due to adverse events. For dichotomous outcomes, we calculated the risk ratio (RR) and 95% confidence interval (95% CI). Data were analyzed on an intention‐to‐treat basis where patients with missing outcome data were assumed to have relapsed. The overall quality of the evidence supporting the primary and secondary outcomes was assessed using the GRADE criteria. Main results A total of six RCTs (326 patients) evaluating therapeutic discontinuation in patients with quiescent CD were eligible for inclusion. In four RCTs azathioprine monotherapy was discontinued, and in two RCTs azathioprine was discontinued from a combination therapy regimen consisting of azathioprine with infliximab. No studies of biologic monotherapy withdrawal were eligible for inclusion. The majority of studies received unclear or low risk of bias ratings, with the exception of three open‐label RCTs, which were rated as high risk of bias for blinding. Four RCTs (215 participants) compared discontinuation to continuation of azathioprine monotherapy, while two studies (125 participants) compared discontinuation of azathioprine from a combination regimen to continuation of combination therapy. Continuation of azathioprine monotherapy was shown to be superior to withdrawal for risk of clinical relapse. Thirty‐two per cent (36/111) of azathioprine withdrawal participants relapsed compared to 14% (14/104) of participants who continued with azathioprine therapy (RR 0.42, 95% CI 0.24 to 0.72, GRADE low quality evidence). However, it is uncertain if there are any between‐group differences in new CD‐related complications (RR 0.34, 95% CI 0.06 to 2.08, GRADE low quality evidence), adverse events (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.67 to 1.17, GRADE low quality evidence), serious adverse events (RR 3.29, 95% CI 0.35 to 30.80, GRADE low quality evidence) or withdrawal due to adverse events (RR 2.59, 95% CI 0.35 to 19.04, GRADE low quality evidence). Common adverse events included infections, mild leukopenia, abdominal symptoms, arthralgias, headache and elevated liver enzymes. No differences between azathioprine withdrawal from combination therapy versus continuation of combination therapy were observed for clinical relapse. Among patients who continued combination therapy with azathioprine and infliximab, 48% (27/56) had a clinical relapse compared to 49% (27/55) of patients discontinued azathioprine but remained on infliximab (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.52, P = 0.32; GRADE low quality evidence). The effects on adverse events (RR 1.11, 95% CI 0.44 to 2.81, GRADE low quality of evidence) or serious adverse events are uncertain (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.21 to 4.66; GRADE very low quality of evidence). Common adverse events in the combination therapy studies included infections, liver test elevations, arthralgias and infusion reactions. Authors' conclusions The effects of withdrawal of immunosuppressant therapy in people with quiescent Crohn's disease are uncertain. Low quality evidence suggests that continuing azathioprine monotherapy may be superior to withdrawal for avoiding clinical relapse, while very low quality evidence suggests that there may be no difference in clinical relapse rates between discontinuing azathioprine from a combination therapy regimen, compared to continuing combination therapy. It is unclear whether withdrawal of azathioprine, initially administered alone or in combination, impacts on the development of CD‐related complications, adverse events, serious adverse events or withdrawal due to adverse events. Further high‐quality research is needed in this area, particularly double‐blind RCTs in which biologic therapy or an immunosuppressant other than azathioprine is withdrawn. Plain language summary Is withdrawal of drug therapy feasible in patients with CD who have achieved remission? Background Crohn's disease is a serious, chronic, inflammatory disease of the small and large intestine. Symptoms include abdominal pain, diarrhea, bleeding and weight loss. When people with Crohn's disease are experiencing symptoms the disease is 'active'. When the symptoms stop, it is called 'remission'. When people in remission experience symptoms it is called a 'relapse'. Immunosuppressant drugs (e.g. azathioprine, 6‐mercaptopurine and methotrexate) and biologic medications (e.g. infliximab, adalimumab, vedolizumab and ustekinumab) are commonly used alone or in combination to treat Crohn's disease. While effective for initially controlling disease (i.e. inducing remission), there are safety and cost concerns regarding the long‐term use of these drugs for the prevention of relapse in people with Crohn's disease in remission. Study characteristics We performed a comprehensive literature review and identified six randomized controlled trials (an experiment in which participants are randomly assigned to receive two or more interventions and the results are compared) that involved a total of 326 participants. Four of the six studies assigned patients who had been receiving azathioprine alone to either continue or discontinue therapy (215 participants). Two of the six studies assigned patients who had been receiving azathioprine in addition to infliximab to continue therapy or discontinue azathioprine (111 participants). Key results Clinical relapse occurred in 13% (14/104) of patients who continued azathioprine monotherapy compared to 32% (36/111) of patients who discontinued azathioprine monotherapy. No differences were observed for Crohn's disease‐related complications, side effects, serious side effects and withdrawal due to side effects. Common side effects included infections, mild decrease in the number of white blood cells, abdominal symptoms, joint pain, headache and elevated liver enzymes. Among patients who continued combination therapy with azathioprine and infliximab, 48% (27/56) had a clinical relapse compared to 49% (27/55) of patients discontinued azathioprine but remained on infliximab. No differences in side effects, serious side effects or withdrawal due to side effects were observed. Common side effects reported in the combination therapy studies included infections, liver test elevations, joint pain and infusion reactions (a hypersensitivity reaction to the biologic medication). Quality of evidence Overall, the quality of evidence for each outcome was low due to a high risk of study bias and small numbers of patients evaluated. Conclusions The effects of withdrawal of immunosuppressant therapy in people with Crohn's disease in remission are uncertain. Low quality evidence suggests that continuing azathioprine monotherapy may be superior to withdrawal of azathioprine for avoiding clinical relapse in people with Crohn's disease in remission. Low quality evidence suggests that stopping the immunosuppressive after combination therapy does not seem to impact on the risk of relapsing. It is unclear whether the withdrawal of azathioprine, initially administered alone or in combination, impacts on the development of Crohn's disease‐related complications, side effects, serious side effects, or withdrawal from the studies due to side effects. Additional research is needed in this area to better inform clinical practice, particularly high‐quality randomized controlled trials examining outcomes when biologic therapy is withdrawn.},

abstract = {Abstract - Background Cerebral toxoplasmosis or toxoplasmic meningoencephalitis (hereafter referred to as TE) was one of the first opportunistic infections to be described in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) ‐infected patients. Treatment of TE has been relatively successful in comparison to other opportunistic infections. Prior to the introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), a median survival of over a year was reported for patients who could tolerate the toxicity of TE treatment. HAART is becoming increasingly widely available in sub‐Saharan Africa, where the majority of HIV‐infected patients live. Many patients in Africa are diagnosed with HIV only after developing opportunistic infections such as TE. Hence, the optimal management of opportunistic infections such as TE is important if the benefits of subsequently initiating HAART are to be seen. Objectives The purpose of this review is to determine the most effective therapy for TE in HIV‐infected adults. Different treatment regimens have been compared with regard to clinical and radiological response, mortality, morbidity, and serious adverse events. Search methods A comprehensive search of relevant databases and other sources was conducted to identify relevant studies. Selection criteria Randomised double‐blinded trials were included. Data collection and analysis Data were extracted using standardised forms and analysed using Rev Man 4.2.7 software. Main results Three trials were found to meet the inclusion criteria. Dannemann et al 1992 and Katlama et al 1996 compared pyrimethamine plus sulfadiazine (P+S) with pyrimethamine plus clindamycin (P+C). Torre 1998 compared P+S with trimethoprim‐sulfamethoxazole (TMP‐SMX). For the purposes of this review, clinical outcomes were analysed as complete or partial resolution vs. failure. Patients who crossed over or were lost to follow‐up were analysed as failures. Dannemann et al 1992 assessed 59 patients. Five of 26 (19%) patients randomised to P+C died in the first 6 weeks compared with 2 of the 33 (6%) patients randomised to P+S (relative risk (RR) 3.17; 95% CI 0.67‐15.06). Complete or partial clinical response was obtained in 12 (46.2%) patients receiving P+C vs. 16 (48.5 %) patients receiving P+S (RR 0.95; 95% CI 0.55‐1.64). Katlama et al 1996 assessed 299 patients. Twenty‐nine (19%) of the 152 patients randomised to P+C died compared with 22 (15%) of the 147 patients randomised to P+S (RR 1.27; 95% CI 0.77‐2.11). We were unable to obtain data on the outcomes of patients who crossed over and therefore excluded these data from the analysis. Dannemann et al 1992 and Katlama et al 1996 were analysed together for the outcome of death. The two treatment arms did not differ for death (RR 1.41; 95% CI 0.88‐2.28). Torre et al 1998 assessed 77 patients. There were no deaths during the study period. Twenty‐eight (70%) of 40 patients randomised to TMP‐SMX had a complete or partial clinical response compared with 26 (70%) of 37 patients randomised to P+S (RR 1.0; 95% CI 0.74‐1.33). Authors' conclusions The available evidence fails to identify any one superior regimen for the treatment of TE. The choice of therapy will often be directed by available therapy. Given the current evidence, TMP‐SMX appears to be an effective alternative therapy for TE in resource‐poor settings where P+S are not available. Plain language summary Management of toxoplasmic encephalitis in HIV‐infected adults (with an emphasis on resource‐poor settings) Cerebral toxoplasmosis, or toxoplasmic meningoencephalitis (TE), was one of the first opportunistic infections to be described in patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Treatment of TE has been relatively successful in comparison to other opportunistic infections. Prior to the introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), a median survival of over a year was reported for patients who could tolerate the toxicity of TE treatment. HAART is becoming increasingly widely available in sub‐Saharan Africa, where the majority of HIV‐infected patients live. Many patients in Africa are diagnosed with HIV only after developing opportunistic infections such as TE. Hence, the optimal management of opportunistic infections such as TE is important if the benefits of subsequently initiating HAART are to be seen. The purpose of this review is to determine the most effective therapy for TE in HIV‐infected adults. Different treatment regimens have been compared with regard to clinical and radiological response, mortality, morbidity, and serious adverse events. Three trials were found to meet the inclusion criteria for this review. Two trials compared pyrimethamine plus sulfadiazine (P+S) with pyrimethamine plus clindamycin (P+C). One trial compared P+S with trimethoprim‐sulfamethoxazole (TMP‐SMX) The available evidence fails to identify any one superior regimen for the treatment of TE. The choice of therapy will often be directed by available therapy. Given the current evidence, TMP‐SMX appears to be an effective alternative therapy for TE in resource‐poor settings where P+S are not available.},
