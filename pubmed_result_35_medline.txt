TI  - Pelvic fractures in severely injured children: Results from the TraumaRegister
      DGU.
PG  - e11955
LID - 10.1097/MD.0000000000011955 [doi]
AB  - Injuries in the pelvic region in children and adolescents are very rare and often
      associated with a high energy trauma. Aim of this prospective multicenter study
      was, by analyzing the data from the TraumaRegister Deutsche Gesellschaft fur
      Unfallchirurgie (TR-DGU), to evaluate any correlation between the severity of
      pelvic fractures and resulting mortality in different age groups.These study
      findings are based on a large pool of data retrieved from the prospectively-setup
      pelvic trauma registry established by the German Trauma Society (DGU) and the
      German Section of the Association for Osteosynthesis/Association for the Study of
      Internal Fixation (AO/ASIF) International in 1991. The registry provides data on 
      all patients suffering pelvic fractures within a 14-year time frame at any 1 of
      the 23 level 1 trauma centers contributing to the registry. The analysis covers 4
      age groups ranging from 0 to 17 years, covering different factors regarding
      pelvic fractures and their treatment.We identified a total of 9684 patients
      including 1433 pelvic fractures in children aged </=17 years. Those patients were
      divided into 4 subgroups according to the patients' age (groups A-D) and
      according to the fracture severity (group 1 = Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS)
      score pelvis </=2, and group 2 = AIS pelvis >/=3). The mortality in group 1 was
      8.8% with a RISC (Revised Injury Severity Score) II of 8.6%, standard mortality
      rate (SMR) of 1.02 and 7.2% in group 2 with an RISC II of 9.9% (SMR 0.73). In
      pelvic factures of Type A (Tile classification of pelvic fractures), an SMR of
      0.76 was recorded, in Type B fractures the SMR was 0.65, and in Type C fractures 
      0.79. Severe pelvic injuries (AIS pelvis >/=2) were associated with a higher rate
      of whole body computer tomograph (CT) scans (1-5 years: 80%, 6-10 years 81.8%,
      11-14 years 84.7%, and 15-17 years 85.6%). The rate of pelvic surgery rose with
      the pelvic injury's severity (AIS 2: 7.6%, AIS 3: 35%, AIS 4: 65.6%, AIS 5
      61.5%). We observed higher rates of preclinical and initial clinical hypotension 
      defined as Riva-Rocci (RR) <90 mmHG) as well as of preclinical fluid application 
      in all age groups. The presence of a pelvic injury was associated with a higher
      rate of severe abdominal injuries with an AIS of >/=3 (25.1% vs. 14.6%) and of
      severe thorax injuries with an AIS>/=3 (43.6% vs. 28.6%).We have been able to
      analyze an enormous number of pelvic fractures in children and adolescents
      including different age groups by relying on data from the TR-DGU. Mortality
      seems to be associated with the severity of the pelvic injury, but is lower than 
      the RISC II score's prognosis.

TI  - Dietary DHA amplifies LXA4 circuits in tissues and lymph node PMN and is
      protective in immune-driven dry eye disease.
PG  - 1674-1683
LID - 10.1038/s41385-018-0070-z [doi]
AB  - Recently identified regulatory PMN control immune-driven dry eye disease (DED) in
      females by producing the arachidonic acid (omega-6)-derived specialized
      pro-resolving mediator (SPM), LXA4, in lymph nodes. Dietary omega-3
      docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) is protective in DED but mechanisms of action remain
      elusive. DHA is converted to omega-3 SPMs by PMN via the same lipoxygenases (LOX)
      that generate LXA4. We investigated if dietary DHA amplifies SPM formation and
      affects T effector cell function and/or regulatory PMN in DED. DED was induced in
      mice on a DHA-enriched or omega-3-deficient diet. DHA deficiency amplified DED
      with marked sex-specific differences. Dietary DHA protection against dry eye
      disease correlated with increased PMN levels in lymph nodes, ocular tissues, and 
      unexpectedly, selective amplification of LXA4 tissue levels. Dietary DHA
      increased 12/15-LOX and decreased 5-LOX expression in lymph nodes and isolated
      lymph node PMN, which correlated with amplified LXA4 formation. Acute DHA
      treatment rescued DHA-deficient females from exaggerated DED by amplifying lymph 
      node LXA4 formation, increasing Treg and decreasing TH1 and TH17 effector cells. 
      Our results identify DHA regulation of LXA4 producing PMN in ocular tissues and
      lymph nodes in health and immune disease as novel mechanism and determinant for
      T-cell responses to routine ocular injury or stress signals.

TI  - Knowledge and Attitude Regarding Radiation Exposure Among Spine Surgeons in Latin
      America.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Spine surgeons are exposed to high amounts of radiation from
      fluoroscopic procedures during their lifetime. In this study, we evaluated spine 
      surgeons' knowledge of and attitude regarding radiation exposure during spine
      surgery. METHODS: We developed a questionnaire including questions about
      surgeons' characteristics and knowledge of and attitude regarding radiation
      exposure during spine surgery. A survey was performed with the members of AOSpine
      Latin America. The main variables studied were specialty, years of experience,
      surgeon's position during fluoroscopy, and practices to reduce the patient's and 
      surgeon's radiation exposure during surgery. The results were analyzed and
      compared among different specialties, levels of experience, and countries of
      origin. RESULTS: The questionnaire was answered by 371 members of AOSpine Latin
      America from different countries. The sample was mostly from orthopedic surgeons 
      (57.1%) and surgeons in practice for longer than 10 years (54.2%). Thyroid lead
      protection was used by 64.2% of the spine surgeons, lead glasses by 20.2%, and
      lead gloves by 7%. A dosimeter badge was never or only rarely used by 75.7%. The 
      correct answer for surgeon position during lateral lumbar fluoroscopy was
      reported by only one-third of the surgeons. The reported rate of thyroid
      protector use was higher in surgeons from Brazil and Colombia compared with
      surgeons from Mexico and Argentina (P < 0.001), whereas the use of pulsed-mode
      fluoroscopy was higher in Mexico and Argentina compared with Brazil and Colombia 
      (P < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Future efforts toward implementing educational
      programs in Latin America focused on safety strategies are needed to minimize
      intraoperative radiation exposure.

AB  - Central neuropathic pain is a debilitating outcome of spinal cord injury (SCI)
      and current treatments to alleviate this pain condition are ineffective. A
      growing body of literature suggests that activating adenosine A2A receptors
      (A2ARs) decreases the production of proinflammatory cytokines and increases the
      production of anti-inflammatory cytokines. Here, the effect of administering
      intrathecal A2AR agonists on central neuropathic pain was measured using hindpaw 
      mechanical allodynia in a rat model of SCI termed spinal neuropathic avulsion
      pain (SNAP). Other models of SCI cause extensive damage to the spinal cord,
      resulting in paralysis and health problems. SNAP rats with unilateral low
      thoracic (T13)/high lumbar (L1) dorsal root avulsion develop below-level
      bilateral allodynia, without concomitant motor or health problems. A single
      intrathecal injection of the A2AR agonist
      2-p-(2-carboxyethyl)phenethylamino-5'-N-ethylcarboxamido adenosine HCl (CGS21680)
      reversed SCI-induced allodynia for at least 6weeks. The reversal is likely in
      part mediated by interleukin (IL)-10, as intrathecally administering neutralizing
      IL-10 antibodies 1week after CGS21680 abolished the anti-allodynic effect of
      CGS21680. Dorsal spinal cord tissue from the ipsilateral site of SCI (T13/L1) was
      assayed 1 and 6weeks after CGS21680 for IL-10, CD11b, and tumor necrosis factor
      (TNF) gene expression. CGS21680 treatment did not change IL-10 gene expression
      but did significantly decrease CD11b and TNF gene expression at both timepoints. 
      A second A2AR agonist,
      4-(3-(6-amino-9-(5-cyclopropylcarbamoyl-3,4-dihydroxytetrahydrofuran-2-yl)-9H-pur
      in-2-yl)prop-2-ynyl)piperidine-1-carboxylic acid methyl ester (ATL313), was also 
      able to significantly prevent and reverse SCI-induced allodynia for several weeks
      after a single intrathecal injection, providing converging lines of evidence of
      A2AR involvement. The enduring pain reversal after a single intrathecal injection
      of A2AR agonists suggests that A2AR agonists could be exciting new candidates for
      treating SCI-induced central neuropathic pain.

TI  - Tat-protein disulfide-isomerase A3: a possible candidate for preventing ischemic 
      damage in the spinal cord.

AB  - In the present study, we searched for possible candidates that can prevent
      ischemic damage in the rabbit spinal cord. For this study, we used
      two-dimensional gel electrophoresis followed by matrix-assisted laser
      desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry, in sham- and
      ischemia-operated animals. As the level of protein disulfide-isomerase A3 (PDIA3)
      significantly decreased 3 h after ischemia/reperfusion, we further investigated
      its possible role against ischemic damage using an in vitro spinal cord cell line
      and in vivo spinal cord ischemic model. The administration of Tat-PDIA3
      significantly reduced the hydrogen peroxide-induced formation of reactive oxygen 
      species and cell death, based on terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated
      biotinylated dUTP nick end labeling and a colorimetric WST-1 assay. Further,
      Tat-PDIA3 significantly ameliorated the ischemia-induced deficits in motor
      function, based on Tarlov's criteria, 24-72 h after ischemia/reperfusion, as well
      as the degeneration of motor neurons in the ventral horn 72 h after
      ischemia/reperfusion. Tat-PDIA3 administration also reduced the ischemia-induced 
      activation of microglia and lipid peroxidation in the motor neurons 72 h after
      ischemia/reperfusion. PDIA3 also potentially ameliorated the ischemia-induced
      increase in oxidative markers in serum and decreased the activity of
      Cu,Zn-superoxide dismutase, Mn-superoxide dismutase, and glutathione peroxidase
      in spinal cord homogenates, 24 h and 72 h after ischemia/reperfusion. These
      results suggest that Tat-PDIA3 could be used to protect spinal cord neurons from 
      ischemic damage, due to its modulatory action on the oxidative/anti-oxidative
      balance. Tat-PDIA3 could be applicable to protects neurons from the ischemic
      damage induced by thoracoabdominal aorta obstruction.

TI  - Comparison between titanium mesh and autogenous iliac bone graft to restore
      vertebral height through posterior approach for the treatment of thoracic and
      lumbar spinal tuberculosis.
PG  - e0175567
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0175567 [doi]
AB  - OBJECT: To compare the clinical efficacy of titanium mesh cages and autogenous
      iliac bone graft to restore vertebral height through posterior approach in
      patients with thoracic and lumbar spinal tuberculosis. METHOD: 59 patients with
      spinal tuberculosis underwent interbody fusion and internal fixation through
      posterior approach in our department from January 2011 to December 2013. In group
      A, 34 patients obtained titanium mesh for the reconstruction of vertebral height,
      among them 25 patients (group A1) suffered from single-segment spinal
      tuberculosis, and 9 patients, (group A2) had multi-segment spinal tuberculosis.
      In group B, 25 patients got autogenous iliac bone graft to restore vertebral
      height, including 24 patients with single-segment spinal tuberculosis (group B1),
      and 1 patient with multi-segment spinal tuberculosis (group B2). The clinical
      efficacy was evaluated based on average operation time, blood loss, hospital
      stays, hospitalization expenses, visual analog scale (VAS), Oswestry Disability
      Index (ODI), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-Reactive protein (CRP),
      neurological function recovery, bony fusion, intervertebral height, Cobb angle
      and postoperative complications. RESULTS: Final follow-up time was an average of 
      35.5 months ranging from 15 to 56 months. All patients were completely cured and 
      obtained solid bone fusion. The bony fusion time was 9.4+/-6.1 months in group
      A1, 10.2+/-2.7 months in group A2 and 8.7+/-3.6 months in group B1. There were no
      significant difference among three groups (P>0.05). The Cobb correction and
      restoration of intervertebral height significantly improved compared with those
      in preoperation, but without significant difference among three groups (P>0.05). 
      The loss of angular correction and intervertebral height in group A1 were found
      to be less than those in group B1 (P<0.05), but with no significant difference
      between group A1 and group A2, and between group A2 and group B1 (P>0.05).
      Patients in group B1 got the most loss of angular correction and intervertebral
      height. In addition, neurological function was revealed to be significantly
      improved after surgery. There were significant differences of VAS, ODI, ESR and
      CRP between preoperation and postoperation at the final follow-up time (P<0.05), 
      with no significant difference among three groups (P>0.05). No statistically
      significant difference was found when analyzing blood loss, hospital stays,
      hospitalization expenses, and corrective cost among three groups (P>0.05).
      Complications included cerebrospinal fluid leakage (2 cases in group A1 and group
      A2), sinus formation (3 cases in group A1, group A2 and group B1), and
      intervertebral infection (1 case in group B1), but no implant failure or donor
      site complications was found in any patient. CONCLUSIONS: Titanium mesh cages
      could obtain good clinical efficacy comparable to autogenous iliac bone graft
      when treating single-segment spinal tuberculosis, and may be better than
      autogenous iliac bone graft for treating multi-segment spinal tuberculosis.

TI  - Resuscitative endovascular balloon occlusion of the aorta versus aortic cross
      clamping among patients with critical trauma: a nationwide cohort study in Japan.
PG  - 400
AB  - BACKGROUND: Measures of aortic occlusion (AO) for resuscitation in patients with 
      severe torso trauma remain controversial. Our aim was to characterize the current
      use of resuscitative endovascular balloon occlusion of the aorta (REBOA) and
      resuscitative open aortic cross-clamping (ACC), and to evaluate whether REBOA
      should be an alternative method to resuscitative open ACC. METHODS: This study
      was a retrospective cohort study between 2004 and 2013 from a nationwide trauma
      registry in Japan. Participants were selected who underwent either REBOA or ACC. 
      Their characteristics, interventions, and outcomes were analyzed to compare REBOA
      and ACC directly. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality and the secondary
      outcome was mortality in the emergency department. Logistic regression analysis
      was performed to compare the outcomes between REBOA and ACC with adjustment for
      severity; 1:1 propensity score matching was also performed. RESULTS: Of the
      159,157 trauma patients, 903 were eligible based on the selection criteria.
      Overall, 405/607 patients (67%) who had REBOA died compared to 210/233 patients
      (90%) who had ACC. Patients with REBOA had higher revised trauma score (RTS)
      (mean +/- SD, 5.2 +/- 2.0 vs. 4.2 +/- 2.2; P < 0.001) but higher Injury Severity 
      Score (ISS) (median (interquartile); 34 (25) vs. 34 (20); P < 0.001), and higher 
      probability of survival (0.43 +/- 0.36 vs. 0.27 +/- 0.30; P < 0.001) compared to 
      those with ACC. REBOA had an odds ratio (OR) for in-hospital mortality of 0.309
      (95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.190-0.502) adjusting for trauma and injury
      severity score using a logistic regression model (n = 903). Similar associations 
      were observed adjusting for RTS (OR = 0.224; 95% CI = 0.129-0.700) or adjusting
      for ISS (OR, 0.188; 95% CI, 0.116 to 0.303). In the propensity score-matched
      cohort (n = 304), REBOA was associated with lower mortality compared to ACC (OR, 
      0.261; 95% CI, 0.130 to 0.523). Patients with REBOA had less severe chest
      complications than those with ACC (Abbreviated Injury Scale thorax, 3.8 +/- 0.8
      vs. 4.2 +/- 0.8; P < 0.001), although physiological severity and backgrounds were
      similar in this population. CONCLUSIONS: Patients who underwent AO had a high
      mortality. REBOA might be a favorable alternative method to resuscitative ACC for
      severe torso trauma although some indication bias could still remain. Further
      studies are needed to elucidate optimal indications.

      A new therapeutic approach towards the prevention of in-stent restenosis.

AB  - UNLABELLED: Drug-eluting stents (DESs), have shown promising results in
      prevention of in-stent restenosis after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).
      The elevated level of leukotrienes (LTs) detected in injured arteries after PCI, 
      together with the potential role of LTs in inflammatory cascades and structural
      alterations in arterial wall provides the rationale for development of
      therapeutic strategies for prevention of in-stent restenosis using LTs receptor
      antagonists. Montelukast (MK) is a selective cysLT1 receptor antagonist, with
      anti-inflammatory and anti-proliferative properties, which has been used for
      treatment of various diseases. Here, we report on the fabrication of MK/PLGA
      particles by electrospraying, aiming towards the development of particle based
      coating of DESs. The electrosprayed particles incorporated with 3% and 6% w/w MK 
      exhibited fairly spherical shape with smooth surfaces and narrow size
      distribution. Sustained release of MK for up to 40days was obtained for both
      formulations, with higher initial burst release and drug release rate for the
      particles with higher drug loading. The LTD4 induced proliferation and migration 
      of human coronary artery smooth muscle cells (HCASMCs) by 35% and 85%,
      respectively, which was substantially antagonized using MK incorporated
      particles. Nevertheless, MK antagonism preserved the normal proliferation and
      migration of human coronary artery endothelial cells (HCAECs). Moreover, MK
      antagonism inhibited the LTD4 induced phenotypic transition of HCASMCs from
      contractile to synthetic type. The electrosprayed MK-PLGA particles can be
      employed as a coating for DESs to inhibit the formation of neointimal hyperplasia
      responsible for in-stent restenosis, yet preserve the healing rate of the stented
      vessel. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANT: Montelukast (MK) is a selective cysLT1 receptor
      antagonist, with anti-inflammatory and anti-proliferative properties. The LTD4
      induced proliferation and migration of human coronary artery smooth muscle cells 
      by 35% and 85%, respectively, which was substantially antagonized using MK
      incorporated particles. MK antagonism preserved the normal proliferation and
      migration of human coronary artery endothelial cells. The MK antagonism inhibited
      the phenotypic transition of human coronary artery smooth muscle cells from
      contractile to synthetic one induced by LTD4. The electrosprayed MK-PLGA
      particles can be employed as coating for DESs to inhibit formation of neointimal 
      hyperplasia, responsible for in-stent restenosis.

TI  - The AAST prospective Aortic Occlusion for Resuscitation in Trauma and Acute Care 
      Surgery (AORTA) registry: Data on contemporary utilization and outcomes of aortic
      occlusion and resuscitative balloon occlusion of the aorta (REBOA).
PG  - 409-19

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Aortic occlusion (AO) for resuscitation in traumatic shock remains 
      controversial. Resuscitative endovascular balloon occlusion of the aorta (REBOA) 
      offers an emerging alternative. METHODS: The American Association for the Surgery
      of Trauma Aortic Occlusion for Resuscitation in Trauma and Acute Care Surgery
      registry prospectively identified trauma patients requiring AO from eight ACS
      Level 1 centers. Presentation, intervention, and outcome variables were collected
      and analyzed to compare REBOA and open AO. RESULTS: From November 2013 to
      February 2015, 114 AO patients were captured (REBOA, 46; open AO, 68); 80.7% were
      male, and 62.3% were blunt injured. Aortic occlusion occurred in the emergency
      department (73.7%) or the operating room (26.3%). Hemodynamic improvement after
      AO was observed in 62.3% [REBOA, 67.4%; open OA, 61.8%); 36.0% achieving
      stability (systolic blood pressure consistently >90 mm Hg, >5 minutes); REBOA, 22
      of 46 (47.8%); open OA, 19 of 68 (27.9%); p =0.014]. Resuscitative endovascular
      balloon occlusion of the aorta (REBOA) access was femoral cut-down (50%); US
      guided (10.9%) and percutaneous without imaging (28.3%). Deployment was achieved 
      in Zones I (78.6%), II (2.4%), and III (19.0%). A second AO attempt was required 
      in 9.6% [REBOA, 2 of 46 (4.3%); open OA, 9 of 68 (13.2%)]. Complications of REBOA
      were uncommon (pseudoaneurysm, 2.1%; embolism, 4.3%; limb ischemia, 0%). There
      was no difference in time to successful AO between REBOA and open procedures
      (REBOA, 6.6 +/- 5.6 minutes; open OA, 7.2 +/- 15.1; p = 0.842). Overall survival 
      was 21.1% (24 of 114), with no significant difference between REBOA and open AO
      with regard to mortality [REBOA, 28.2% (13 of 46); open OA, 16.1% (11 of 68); p =
      0.120]. CONCLUSION: Resuscitative endovascular balloon occlusion of the aorta has
      emerged as a viable alternative to open AO in centers that have developed this
      capability. Further maturation of the American Association for the Surgery of
      Trauma Aortic Occlusion for Resuscitation in Trauma and Acute Care Surgery
      database is required to better elucidate optimal indications and outcomes. LEVEL 
      OF EVIDENCE: Therapeutic/care management study, level IV.

TI  - Claustrum damage and refractory status epilepticus following febrile illness.
PG  - 1224-32
LID - 10.1212/WNL.0000000000001996 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To characterize the clinical, EEG, and brain imaging findings in an
      adult case series of patients with de novo refractory status epilepticus (SE)
      occurring after a febrile illness. METHODS: A retrospective study (2010-2013) was
      undertaken with the following inclusion criteria: (1) previously healthy adults
      with refractory SE; (2) seizure onset 0-21 days after a febrile illness; (3)
      lacking evidence of infectious agents in CSF; (4) no history of seizures (febrile
      or afebrile) or previous or concomitant neurologic disorder. RESULTS: Among 155
      refractory SE cases observed in the study period, 6 patients (17-35 years old)
      fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Confusion and stupor were the most common
      symptoms at disease onset, followed after a few days by acute repeated seizures
      that were uncountable in all but one. Seizures consisted of focal motor/myoclonic
      phenomena with subsequent generalization. Antiepileptic drugs failed in every
      patient to control seizures, with all participants requiring intensive care unit 
      admission. Barbiturate coma with burst-suppression pattern was applied in 4 out
      of 6 patients for 5-14 days. One participant died in the acute phase. In each
      patient, we observed a reversible bilateral claustrum MRI hyperintensity on
      T2-weighted sequences, without restricted diffusion, time-related with SE. All
      patients had negative multiple neural antibodies testing. Four out of 5 surviving
      patients developed chronic epilepsy. CONCLUSIONS: This is a hypothesis-generating
      study of a preliminary nature supporting the role of the claustrum in postfebrile
      de novo SE; future prospective studies are needed to delineate the specificity of
      this condition, its pathogenesis, and the etiology.

TI  - The potential therapeutic targets to bone pain induced by cancer metastasis.
PG  - S135-41
LID - 10.4103/0973-1482.122508 [doi]
AB  - About 75-90% of patients with advanced metastatic cancer experience significant
      cancer pain. Bone cancer pain is one of the most common pains experienced by
      patients with advanced breast, prostate, or lung cancer. It is characterized by
      significant skeletal remodeling, fractures, pain, and anemia, all of which reduce
      the functional status, quality of life, and survival of the patient. Recent years
      have seen great progress toward alleviating bone pain with the identification of 
      a range of chemicals as well as receptors modulating cancer pain progression.
      However, the complicated interactions among these factors and, sometimes, the
      contradicting effects of the same factor in different pathways make it difficult 
      to spot individual effective targets. The sheer quantity of the chemicals
      involved and the limited understanding from animal models are the constraints in 
      the development of effective therapies for cancer bone pain. In this review, key 
      targets will be discussed along the pain transduction pathway, including
      peripheral pain sensation, spinal cord transduction pathway, and the central
      nervous system, to offer a logical and systematic study for the development of
      combined anti-bone pain treatments.

TI  - [Effects of electro-acupuncture combined general anesthesia on myocardial injury 
      of high blood sugar patients with coronary heart disease in the perioperative
      phase].
PG  - 1607-10
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of electro-acupuncture (EA) combined
      general anesthesia on myocardial injury of high blood sugar patients with
      coronary heart disease (CHD) in the perioperative phase. METHODS: Recruited were 
      40 senile patients with glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) more than 6.5%. They were
      more than 60 years old. They received post-traumatic fracture reduction surgery
      of four limbs. They were randomly assigned to two groups, Group N (treated by
      general intravenous anesthesia) and Group D (treated by EA combined with general 
      intravenous anesthesia), 20 in each group. All patients were maintained
      anesthesia by propofol, fentanyl, and vecuronium. Prior to the induction of
      anesthesia, patients in Group D received induction of EA at Neiguan (PC6) and
      Baihui (DU20) for 20 min, which lasted to the end of the surgery. At before
      intubation (T0), immediately after intubation (T1), 5 min (T2), immediately after
      extubation (T3), 5 min (T4), 60 min (T5), 180 min (T6), the fast blood glucose
      (FBG), plasma vasoactive substance TXB2 and 6-K-prostacycline (6-K-PGF1alpha)
      were detected in the two groups. The glucose coefficient of variation (GluCV) and
      the ratio of TXB2/6-K-PGF1alpha were calculated. The changes of ST-segment
      elevation (mV, sampling 1 min after each time point, and the mean calculated) was
      recorded. RESULTS: There was no statistical difference in all the tested values
      between the two groups at T0 (P>0.05). The FBG, ST elevation, and the ratio of
      TXB2/6-K-PGF1alpha were significantly higher at each time point than at T0 in
      Group N (P<0.05), while there was no statistical difference in Group D (P>0.05). 
      The ratio of TXB2/6-K-PGF1alpha and ST elevation were significantly higher in
      Group N than in Group D (P<0.01). The TXB2 and 6-K-PGF1alpha were significantly
      higher at each time point than at T0 in the two groups (P<0.05). The increment of
      TXB2 was obviously lower in Group D than in Group N (P<0.05), but the increment
      of 6-K-PGF1alpha was obviously higher in Group D than in Group N (P<0.05).
      CONCLUSION: EA could reduce the perioperative stress response to the injury of
      coronary vascular endothelial cells, and improve myocardial ischemia and CHD
      patients' prognosis by regulating the central nervous system, the cardiovascular 
      active substances, and anti-oxygen free radicals.

TI  - X-treme CT analysis of cancellous bone at the rotator cuff insertion in human
      individuals with osteoporosis: superficial versus deep quality.
PG  - 381-7
LID - 10.1007/s00402-012-1663-8 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Rotator cuff (RC) repair-especially in the elderly population-is
      problematic since the patients suffer to a high extent from bone mineral density 
      loss at the reattachment site. Therefore, the study was primarily driven by the
      question whether it is possible to reach more or qualitatively better cancellous 
      bone and thus a more stable postoperative result if anchors with greater length
      are used for RC repair and/or the conventional anchors are screwed deeper into
      the bone. In anatomical terms, the question is raised whether cancellous bone is 
      of better quality close to or far off the RC enthesis. METHODS: Axial HRqCT scans
      (X-tremeCT, Scanco Medical) of 36 human cadaveric humeral heads (75 +/- 11 years)
      were performed to determine the ratio of bone volume to total volume (BV/TV),
      trabecular thickness (Trab Th), number of trabecles (Trab N), trabecular
      separation (Trab Sp) as well as non-metric indices such as connectivity density
      (Conn Dens) and structure model index (SMI). Within the greater tuberosity (GT), 
      6 volumes of interest (VOI) (A1, B1, C1, A2, B2, C2), in the lesser tuberosity
      (LT) 2 VOIs (D1, D2) and one control VOI in the subchondral bone were set. The
      analyzed bone cylinder of each VOI was divided into a superficial and a deep
      portion. RESULTS: The parameters BV/TV, Trab N, Trab Th and Conn Dens in all
      volumes of the GT and LT revealed higher values in the superficial portion
      reaching different levels of significance (p < 0.001/<0.05). The only parameter
      presenting a higher value in the deep portion was Trab Sp, but this was the case 
      for all GT and LT regions. Interestingly, the difference between the superficial 
      and deep portion reached significance for the non-metric parameter SMI in no
      volume of the GT/LT, although the higher values were found superficially.
      CONCLUSIONS: Our data show that cancellous bone presents with decreasing bone
      quality when analyzing increasingly deeper portions of the bone cylinders of the 
      GT and LT starting at the articular surface. This information seems to be crucial
      for shoulder surgeons, especially when treating elderly patients. Our results
      clearly prove that screwing in anchors to a deeper extent will not improve
      stability, since the deeper bone stock is of worse quality.

TI  - Diaphragmatic height index: new diagnostic test for phrenic nerve dysfunction.
PG  - 890-6
LID - 10.3171/2012.8.JNS111734 [doi]
AB  - OBJECT: The diaphragmatic height index (DHI) was developed to measure the
      difference in diaphragm levels. The purpose of this study was to set definite DHI
      values and test the accuracy of these values for use as a new diagnostic test for
      phrenic nerve dysfunction. METHODS: All data for this study were obtained from
      medical charts and retrospectively reviewed. RESULTS: One hundred sixty-five
      patients with brachial plexus injury who had undergone nerve transfers between
      2005 and 2008 were divided into Groups A and B. Group A consisted of 40 patients 
      (mean age 28.0 years) who had sustained concomitant injury of the brachial plexus
      and phrenic nerves. Patients in Group A1 had right phrenic nerve injury and those
      in Group A2 had left phrenic nerve injury. Intraoperative direct electrical
      stimulation of the phrenic nerve was considered the gold standard in assessing
      nerve function in all patients with brachial plexus injury. Group B consisted of 
      125 patients (mean age 28.7 years) with brachial plexus injury and normal phrenic
      nerve function. Group C, the control group, consisted of 80 patients with
      nonbrachial plexus injury (mean age 34.0 years) who had undergone other kinds of 
      orthopedic operations between April and June 2009. Standard posteroanterior chest
      radiographs were blindly interpreted using the Siriraj inhouse picture archiving 
      and communication system in all 245 patients in the study. First, a reference
      line (R line) was drawn along the inferior endplate of T-10. Then, 2 lines (lines
      A and B) were drawn through the highest point of each diaphragm and parallel to
      the R line. The difference between these 2 lines divided by the height of T-10
      was defined as the DHI. The cutoff points of the DHI for diagnosing right and
      left phrenic nerve dysfunction were analyzed with a receiver operating
      characteristic curve. The accuracy of these DHI values was then evaluated. The
      DHI in Group C was 0.64 +/- 0.44, slightly higher than the DHI in Group B, with
      no significant difference. Diaphragmatic height indexes in Groups A1 and A2 were 
      2.0 +/- 0.99 and -1.04 +/- 0.83, respectively, which were significantly different
      from those in Groups B and C (p < 0.05). The cutoff point of the DHI for
      diagnosing right phrenic nerve dysfunction was > 1.1, and that for left phrenic
      nerve dysfunction was < 0.2. The sensitivity and specificity of right and left
      DHI values were 90.5% and 86.3%, and 94.7 and 88.3%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS:
      Data in this study show that diaphragm paralysis can be simply and reliably
      predicted by the DHI. Diaphragmatic height index values > 1.1 and < 0.2 are
      proposed as the new diagnostic test for right and left phrenic nerve dysfunction 
      with a high degree of accuracy. This index is applicable in diagnosing phrenic
      nerve dysfunction that occurs concomitantly with brachial plexus injury or from
      other etiologies.

TI  - Enhanced control of in vivo bone formation with surface functionalized alginate
      microbeads incorporating heparin and human bone morphogenetic protein-2.
PG  - 350-9
LID - 10.1089/ten.TEA.2012.0274 [doi]
AB  - In this study, we tested the hypothesis that a surface functionalization delivery
      platform incorporating heparin onto strontium alginate microbeads surfaces would 
      convert this "naive carriers" into "mini-reservoirs" for localized in vivo
      delivery of recombinant human bone morphogenetic protein-2 (rhBMP-2) that will
      induce functional bone regeneration. In vitro evaluation confirmed that (1)
      heparin incorporation could immobilize and prolong rhBMP-2 release for
      approximately 3 weeks; (2) a significant decrease (p<0.01) in rhBMP-2 burst
      release is attainable depending on initial protein load; and (3) rhBMP-2 released
      from surface functionalized microbeads retained bioactivity and stimulated higher
      alkaline phosphatase activity in cultured C(2)C(12) cells when compared with
      daily administration of fresh bolus rhBMP-2. Subsequently, surface functionalized
      microbeads were used for in vivo delivery of rhBMP-2 at local sites of
      posterolateral spinal fusion surgery in rats. The microbeads were loaded into the
      pores of medical-grade polyepsilone caprolactone-tricalcium phosphate scaffolds
      before implantation. Results revealed robust bone formation and a biomechanically
      solid fusion after 6 weeks. When compared with a control group consisting of an
      equivalent amount of rhBMP-2 that was directly adsorbed onto bare-surfaced
      microbeads with no heparin, a 5.3-fold increase in bone volume fraction and a
      2.6-fold increase in bending stiffness (flexion/extension) were observed. When
      compared with collagen sponge carriers of rhBMP-2, a 1.5-fold and a 1.3-fold
      increase in bone volume fraction and bending stiffness were observed,
      respectively. More importantly, 3D micro-computed tomography images enabled the
      visualization of a well-contained newly formed bone at ipsilateral implant sites 
      with surface functionalized rhBMP-2 delivery. This was absent with collagen
      sponge carriers where newly formed bone tissue was poorly contained and crossed
      over the posterior midline to contralateral implants. These findings are
      important because of complications with current rhBMP-2 delivery method,
      including excessive, uncontrolled bone formation.

TI  - Niacin and biosynthesis of PGD(2)by platelet COX-1 in mice and humans.
PG  - 1459-68
LID - 10.1172/JCI59262 [doi]
LID - 59262 [pii]
AB  - The clinical use of niacin to treat dyslipidemic conditions is limited by noxious
      side effects, most commonly facial flushing. In mice, niacin-induced flushing
      results from COX-1-dependent formation of PGD(2) and PGE(2) followed by
      COX-2-dependent production of PGE(2). Consistent with this, niacin-induced
      flushing in humans is attenuated when niacin is combined with an antagonist of
      the PGD(2) receptor DP1. NSAID-mediated suppression of COX-2-derived PGI(2) has
      negative cardiovascular consequences, yet little is known about the
      cardiovascular biology of PGD(2). Here, we show that PGD(2) biosynthesis is
      augmented during platelet activation in humans and, although vascular expression 
      of DP1 is conserved between humans and mice, platelet DP1 is not present in mice.
      Despite this, DP1 deletion in mice augmented aneurysm formation and the
      hypertensive response to Ang II and accelerated atherogenesis and thrombogenesis.
      Furthermore, COX inhibitors in humans, as well as platelet depletion, COX-1
      knockdown, and COX-2 deletion in mice, revealed that niacin evoked platelet
      COX-1-derived PGD(2) biosynthesis. Finally, ADP-induced spreading on fibrinogen
      was augmented by niacin in washed human platelets, coincident with increased
      thromboxane (Tx) formation. However, in platelet-rich plasma, where formation of 
      both Tx and PGD(2) was increased, spreading was not as pronounced and was
      inhibited by DP1 activation. Thus, PGD(2), like PGI(2), may function as a
      homeostatic response to thrombogenic and hypertensive stimuli and may have
      particular relevance as a constraint on platelets during niacin therapy.

TI  - Lipoxin A4 inhibits immune cell binding to salivary epithelium and vascular
      endothelium.
PG  - C968-78
LID - 10.1152/ajpcell.00259.2011 [doi]
AB  - Lipoxins are formed by leukocytes during cell-cell interactions with epithelial
      or endothelial cells. Native lipoxin A(4) (LXA(4)) binds to the G protein-coupled
      lipoxin receptors formyl peptide receptor 2 (FPR2)/ALX and CysLT1. Furthermore,
      LXA(4) inhibits recruitment of neutrophils, by attenuating chemotaxis, adhesion, 
      and transmigration across vascular endothelial cells. LXA(4) thus appears to
      serve as an endogenous "stop signal" for immune cell-mediated tissue injury
      (Serhan CN; Annu Rev Immunol 25: 101-137, 2007). The role of LXA(4) has not been 
      addressed in salivary epithelium, and little is known about its effects on
      vascular endothelium. Here, we determined that interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) and
      tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) receptor activation in vascular
      endothelium and salivary epithelium upregulated the expression of adhesion
      molecules that facilitates the binding of immune cells. We hypothesize that the
      activation of the ALX/FPR2 and/or CysLT1 receptors by LXA(4) decreases this
      cytokine-mediated upregulation of cell adhesion molecules that enhance lymphocyte
      binding to both the vascular endothelium and salivary epithelium. In agreement
      with this hypothesis, we observed that nanomolar concentrations of LXA(4) blocked
      IL-1beta- and TNF-alpha-mediated upregulation of E-selectin and intercellular
      cell adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) on human umbilical vein endothelial cells
      (HUVECs). Binding of Jurkat cells to stimulated HUVECs was abrogated by LXA(4).
      Furthermore, LXA(4) preincubation with human submandibular gland cell line (HSG) 
      also blocked TNF-alpha-mediated upregulation of vascular cell adhesion molecule-1
      (VCAM-1) in these cells, and it reduced lymphocyte adhesion. These findings
      suggest that ALX/FPR2 and/or CysLT1 receptor activation in endothelial and
      epithelial cells blocks cytokine-induced adhesion molecule expression and
      consequent binding of lymphocytes, a critical event in the pathogenesis of
      Sjogren's syndrome (SS).

TI  - NRF2 deficiency reduces life span of mice administered thoracic irradiation.
PG  - 1175-83
LID - 10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2011.05.038 [doi]
AB  - Subsets of cancer survivors who have been subjected to thoracic irradiation face 
      the prospect of developing pulmonary injury. Radiation-induced pulmonary fibrosis
      is an insidious injury that presents 6 to 24 months after irradiation and
      continues to progress over a period of years. TGF-beta and reactive oxygen
      species contribute significantly to the pathogenesis of this injury. The
      transcription factor NRF2 controls antioxidant gene expression and therefore
      regulates the cellular oxidant burden. This work demonstrates an additional
      paradigm for NRF2: suppression of TGF-beta-mediated signaling, assessed by
      measuring expression of a surrogate TGF-beta1 target gene (PAI-1) in lung
      fibroblasts. Thoracic irradiation of Nfe2l2(-/-) mice resulted in rapid
      expression of PAI-1 and FSP-1 compared to irradiated wild-type mice. Examination 
      of lung tissue 16 weeks after thoracic irradiation of Nfe2l2(-/-) mice revealed
      the presence of distended alveoli and decreased numbers of alveoli compared to
      wild-type mice. Suppression of NRF2 expression shortened life span in mice
      administered 16 Gy to the thorax. Nfe2l2(+/-) and Nfe2l2(-/-) mice exhibited a
      mean life span of 176 days compared to wild-type mice, which lived an average of 
      212 days. These novel results identify NRF2 as a susceptibility factor for the
      development of late tissue injury.

TI  - An analytic approach to double dosimetry algorithms in occupational dosimetry
      using energy dependent organ dose conversion coefficients.
PG  - 800-5
LID - 10.1097/HP.0b013e3181e850da [doi]
AB  - Personnel dose in diagnostic radiology is often underestimated. Typically the
      effective dose E is estimated based on dosimeters worn underneath the protective 
      clothing measuring the personal dose equivalent Hp(10). This one-spot-measurement
      systematically neglects the exposure to the unshielded organs in the head and
      neck region. In this paper, energy dependent double dosimetry algorithms in the
      range of 30-80 keV are derived using organ dose conversion coefficients. The
      doses of shielded organs are assigned to a single dosimeter in the anterior
      thoracic region (chest) underneath the apron (Hp,c,u), and the doses of the
      organs not shielded are assigned to another dosimeter placed on the front area of
      the neck over the protective garment (Hp,n,o) with E = a1 Hp,c,u(10) + a2
      Hp,n,o(10). Organs not completely shielded are categorized correspondingly. The
      coefficients a1 and a2 increase with higher energies up to 70 keV. The factors a2
      are clearly higher according to ICRP 103 (rather than ICRP 60) because ICRP 103
      considers additional organs in the head and neck region. According to ICRP 103, a
      conservative general algorithm with thyroid protection is E = 0.84 Hp,c,u(10) +
      0.051 Hp,n,o(10) and without thyroid protection E = 0.79 Hp,c,u(10) + 0.100
      Hp,n,o(10).

AB  - PURPOSE: To determine the effectiveness, reliability and donor site morbidity of 
      pectoral nerve transfers in the treatment of brachial plexus lesions. METHODS:
      This retrospective study included 6 patients with 7 pectoral nerve transfers. The
      follow-up examination comprised measurement of the ranges of motion (AO neutral-0
      method), functional muscle testing (British Medical Research Council), and photo-
      and videographic documentation. RESULTS: Three patients achieved excellent
      results (M5, M4), in 3 cases good muscle function was achieved (M3) and 1
      patient, who had a short follow-up period, revealed M2 motor function.
      CONCLUSIONS: This study describes the treatment of patients with conditions far
      from ideal. All patients sustained extensive brachial plexus lesions and most had
      severe associated injuries of the upper limb, which limited the availability of
      sufficient donor nerves. Despite these facts, 6 cases had excellent or good
      results and 1 showed continuing improvement of muscle function. These good
      results and the excellent results documented in literature demonstrate the high
      dependability and efficiency of the pectoral nerves as donors in the treatment of
      brachial plexus lesions. Furthermore, it was shown that free functioning muscle
      transplants can be sufficiently reinnervated by pectoral nerves. TYPE OF
      STUDY/LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Therapeutic IV.

TI  - Optimal 3-T MRI for depiction of the finger A2 pulley: comparison between
      T1-weighted, fat-saturated T2-weighted and gadolinium-enhanced fat-saturated
      T1-weighted sequences.
PG  - 307-12
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare three spin-echo sequences, transverse T1-weighted (T1WI),
      transverse fat-saturated (FS) T2-weighted (T2WI), and transverse
      gadolinium-enhanced (Gd) FS T1WI, for the visualisation of normal and abnormal
      finger A2 pulley with magnetic resonance (MR) imaging at 3 tesla (T). MATERIALS
      AND METHODS: Sixty-three fingers from 21 patients were consecutively
      investigated. Two musculoskeletal radiologists retrospectively compared all
      sequences to assess the visibility of normal and abnormal A2 pulleys and the
      presence of motion or ghost artefacts. RESULTS: Normal and abnormal A2 pulleys
      were visible in 94% (59/63) and 95% (60/63) on T1WI sequences, in 63% (40/63) and
      60% (38/63) on FS T2WI sequences, and in 87% (55/63) and 73% (46/63) on Gd FS
      T1WI sequences when read by the first and second observer, respectively. Motion
      and ghost artefacts were higher on FS T2WI sequences. Seven among eight abnormal 
      A2 pulleys were detected, and were best depicted with Gd FS T1WI sequences in 71%
      (5/7) and 86% (6/7) by the first and the second observer, respectively.
      CONCLUSION: In 3-T MRI, the comparison between transverse T1WI, FS T2WI, and Gd
      FS T1WI sequences shows that transverse T1WI allows excellent depiction of the A2
      pulley, that FS T2WI suffers from a higher rate of motion and ghost artefacts,
      and transverse Gd FS T1WI is the best sequence for the depiction of abnormal A2
      pulley.

      high mortality rates. Whereas the role of innate immunity in acute lung injury
      has been broadly investigated, the immune response after blunt chest trauma is
      still poorly understood. Therefore, the role of complement and neutrophils was
      determined in bilateral lung injury induced by a single blast wave. The following
      time-points were investigated posttrauma: sham, 1, 6, 12, and 24 h. There was a
      time-dependent systemic activation of complement as determined by CH-50 and
      presence of C5a-dependent chemotactic plasma activity. Moreover, factor H, a
      complement regulatory protein, was increased systemically and locally after
      injury. Anti-C5a treatment immediately after trauma ameliorated these peaks.
      After an initial systemic leukopenic phase, a marked leukocytosis occurred. The
      latter was normalized by C5a blockade. In parallel, white blood cell count in
      bronchioalveolar lavage fluids was increased as a function of time and was
      significantly decreased by anti-C5a treatment. Trauma-induced lung injury was
      also associated with dramatic changes in neutrophil function, namely early
      enhanced chemotaxis and phagocytosis, followed by prolonged functional
      defects-all of which were ameliorated by anti-C5a treatment. Furthermore,
      blockade of C5a ameliorated the buildup of the proinflammatory cytokine
      TNF-alpha, diminished the increase of cytokine-induced neutrophil chemoattractant
      1, and altered the levels of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10. These data
      suggest that blunt chest trauma leads to systemic activation of complement and
      robust C5a generation, which causes perturbations in defensive functions of
      neutrophils. Thus, C5a might represent a potential target for therapeutic
      immunomodulation to prevent immune dysfunctions post-trauma and thereby, perhaps,
      the progression to acute respiratory distress syndrome.

TI  - The evolution of ischemic spinal cord injury in function, cytoarchitecture, and
      inflammation and the effects of adenosine A2A receptor activation.
PG  - 925-32
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Spinal cord ischemia/reperfusion injury involves multiple factors that
      may be modulated by adenosine A 2A receptor activation. This study defines injury
      progression in terms of function, cytoarchitecture, and inflammation and assesses
      whether adenosine A 2A receptor activation by ATL-146e limits injury progression.
      METHODS: Mature swine were divided into 3 groups: sham thoracotomy, IR (30
      minutes of ischemia followed by reperfusion), and ATL (ischemia/reperfusion with 
      ATL-146e administration for the first 3 hours of reperfusion). Subgroups were
      killed at 0, 3, 6, 12, 24, and 48 hours after reperfusion. Function was followed 
      up with Tarlov scores. Spinal cord tissue was evaluated for neuronal viability,
      microtubule-associated protein-2 immunohistochemistry, and neutrophil
      sequestration (myeloperoxidase assay). Spinal cord tissue, cerebrospinal fluid,
      and serum were evaluated for tumor necrosis factor-alpha by enzyme-linked
      immunosorbent assay. RESULTS: Function was significantly impaired at 24, 36, and 
      48 hours in the IR group compared with the sham and ATL groups ( P < .05).
      Neuronal viability and microtubule-associated protein-2 staining were
      significantly preserved in the sham and ATL groups compared with the IR group at 
      24 and 48 hours ( P < .05). Spinal cord myeloperoxidase levels were significantly
      higher in the IR group than in the sham and ATL groups at 24 and 48 hours.
      Although negligible in serum and cerebrospinal fluid, tumor necrosis factor-alpha
      levels in the spinal cord peaked significantly higher in the IR group compared
      with the sham and ATL groups at 6 and 24 hours ( P < .05). CONCLUSIONS: Spinal
      cord ischemia/reperfusion induced changes in neutrophil sequestration,
      microtubule-associated protein-2 expression, and neuronal viability within 24
      hours of reperfusion. Spinal cord tumor necrosis factor-alpha increased
      significantly by 6 to 12 hours after reperfusion. Adenosine A 2A receptor
      activation attenuates spinal cord inflammation, which may be critical for the
      preservation of neuronal function and cytoarchitecture after
      ischemia/reperfusion.

TI  - The role of pharmacology in spinal cord protection during thoracic aortic
      reconstruction.
PG  - 365-77
AB  - Surgery of the thoracic aorta continues to have a significant risk of neurologic 
      complication. Several strategies to minimize this risk are emerging.
      Pharmacologic protection from these complications continues to be researched, but
      at this point few medications are being used clinically. This article reviews the
      pathophysiology of ischemic spinal cord injury and summarizes the investigational
      pharmacology that may prevent these serious complications.

TI  - Regulation of heme oxygenase expression by cyclopentenone prostaglandins.
PG  - 499-505
AB  - Prostaglandins (PGs) originate from the degradation of membranar arachidonic acid
      by cyclooxygenases (COX-1 and COX-2). The prostaglandin actions in the nervous
      system are multiple and have been suggested to play a significant role in
      neurodegenerative disorders. Some PGs have been reported to be toxic and,
      interestingly, the cyclopentenone PGs have been reported to be cytoprotective at 
      low concentration and could play a significant role in neuronal plasticity. They 
      have been shown to be protective against oxidative stress injury; however, the
      cellular mechanisms of protection afforded by these PGs are still unclear. It is 
      postulated that the cascade leading to neuronal cell death in acute and chronic
      neurodegenerative conditions, such as cerebral ischemia and Alzheimer's disease, 
      would be mediated by free radical damage. We tested the hypothesis that the
      neuroprotective action of cyclopentanone could be caused partially by an
      induction of heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1). We and others have previously reported that
      modulation of HO total activity may well have direct physiological implications
      in stroke and in Alzheimer's disease. HO acts as an antioxidant enzyme by
      degrading heme into iron, carbon monoxide, and biliverdin that is rapidly
      converted into bilirubin. Using mouse primary neuronal cultures, we demonstrated 
      that PGs of the J series induce HO-1 in a dose-dependent manner (0, 0.5, 5, 10,
      20, and 50 micro g/ml) and that PGJ(2) and dPGJ(2) were more potent than PGA(2), 
      dPGA(2), PGD(2), and PGE(2). No significant effects were observed for HO-2 and
      actin expression. In regard to HO-3 expression found in rat, with its protein
      deducted sequence highly homologous to HO-2, no detection was observed in
      HO-2(-/-) mice, suggesting that HO-3 protein would not be present in mouse brain.
      We are proposing that several of the protective effects of PGJ(2) could be
      mediated through beneficial actions of heme degradation and its metabolites. The 
      design of new mimetics based on the cyclopentenone structure could be very useful
      as neuroprotective agents and be tested in animal models of stroke and
      Alzheimer's disease.

      ischemia-reperfusion in patients undergoing intracardiac surgery].
PG  - 896-8
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of Salvia miltiorrhiza compound injection
      (SMCI) on serum endothelin (ET), prostaglandin I2(PGI2), thromboxane A2(TXA2),
      and PGI2/TXA2 ratio following myocardial ischemia-reperfusion in patients
      undergoing intracardiac surgery. METHODS: Twenty patients, scheduled for
      selective surgery, were randomly divided into the SMCI group (group A, 10 cases) 
      and the control group (group B, 10 cases). SMCI 200 mg/kg was given intravenously
      in group A before starting the operation and at the time of rewarming
      respectively, and equivalent volumes of normal saline were administered to group 
      B. The central venous blood samples were collected to measure the serum
      concentration of ET, PGI2, TXA2, and PGI2/TXA2 ratio. RESULTS: ET significantly
      reduced, while PGI2 and TXA2 obviously raised in both groups at the beginning
      (T1) of extracorporeal cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) (P < 0.05). After cardiac
      ischemia-reperfusion, ET in group B increased rapidly and significantly (P <
      0.05) and evidently higher than the corresponding value in group A 30 min after
      reperfusion (T3) till 24 hrs after reperfusion (T5). During reperfusion, PGI2 and
      TXA2 in group A decreased more rapidly than that of group B, while group A
      maintained higher PGI2/TXA2 ratio than that of group B. At T5, PGI2 and TXA2 in
      group A were significantly lower than those in group B, while PGI2/TXA2 ratio was
      higher than that in group B (P < 0.05). The serum ET level was obviously
      negatively correlated to PGI2/TXA2 ratio. The postoperative cardiac function
      recovered much better in group A than in that group B. CONCLUSION: SMCI can
      significantly reduce serum ET level, raise PGI2/TXA2 ratio, thus facilitate the
      postoperative cardiac function recovery following intracardiac surgery under CPB.

AB  - The ability of an albumin-based hydrogel sealant (ABHS) to prevent air leakage
      through the suture line after pulmonary surgery was evaluated by comparison with 
      that of a fibrin glue (FG). As an air-leak model, a rat lung was used in which a 
      standard incision was made and the burst pressure for ABHS and FG was measured.
      The average burst pressures at time 0 for the FG and ABHS groups were 30.8+/-15.2
      and 77.5 +/-19.1 mmHg, respectively. At Day 3, the value of ABHS (76.3 +/- 15.8
      mmHg) was still significantly higher (P<0.05) than that of FG (60.0 +/- 21.9
      mmHg). At Day 7, no statistical difference was observed between the FG group(71.2
      +/- 18.6 mmHg) and the ABHS group(88.8 +/- 11.7 mmHg). Histological examination
      of the incision at Day 14 revealed that neither sealant was not visible at the
      incision site, and there was no evidence of adverse tissue reaction. It was
      concluded that ABHS had good sealing properties and is an alternative to FG for
      air leakage treatment in pulmonary surgery.

      others, with biosynthesis and release of nitric oxide (NO), prostacyclin (PGI2), 
      prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), carbon monoxide (CO) and plasminogen activator (t-PA).
      These endothelial mediators calm down activated platelets and leukocytes, prevent
      the occurrence of parietal thrombotic events, promote thrombolysis, maintain
      tissue perfusion and protect vascular wall against acute damage and against
      chronic remodeling. Endothelial dysfunction in patients suffering from
      atherosclerosis or diabetes type 2 is associated not only with suppression in
      release of the above mediators but also with deleterious discharge of
      prostaglandin endoperoxides (PGH2, PGG2), superoxide anion (O2-, peroxynitrite
      (ONOO-), and plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI-1). We looked for mechanisms of
      protective endothelial function, with a special respect to the differences
      between peripheral and pulmonary circulation. METHODS: Cultured endothelial cells
      of bovine aorta (BAEC) were used to study physiological and pharmacological
      mechanisms of increasing free cytoplasmic calcium [Ca2+]i. A porphyrinic sensor
      quantified the release of NO from BAEC. In cultured human umbilical vein
      endothelial cells (HUVEC) we looked for induction by bradykinin (Bk) of mRNAs for
      a number of enzymes. In blood perfused rat lungs we studied protective role of NO
      against injury inferred by lipopolysaccharide on pulmonary microcirculation that 
      was accomplished by thromboxane A2 (TXA2), platelet activating factor (PAF),
      cysteinyl-leukotrienes (cyst-LTs) and the complement system. In vivo we analyzed 
      the influence of Bk, perindopril and quinapril ('tissue type' angiotensin
      converting enzyme inhibitors, ACE-Is) on endothelial function in entire
      circulation of anaesthetized rats using a thrombolytic bioassay and EIA for
      6-keto-PGF1 alpha and t-PA antigen. RESULTS: In BAEC Bk via kinin B2 receptors
      raised in a concentration-dependent manner (1 pM-10 nM) free cytoplasmic calcium 
      ions [Ca2+]i, that triggered the release of NO from BAEC. Calcium ionophore
      (A23187, 1-100 nM) as well as receptor agonists such as adenosine diphosphate
      (ADP, 10 nM-1 microM), adrenaline (Adr, 1-10 microM) or acetylcholine (Ach,
      10-100 microM) produced a similar rise in endothelial [Ca2+]i as did Bk at a
      nanomolar concentration. 'Tissue type' ACE-Is, e.g. quinapril or perindopril
      acted through accumulation of endogenous Bk. However, the potency of ACE-I to
      change endothelial function is by several orders of magnitude lower than that for
      exogenous Bk. In vivo the major difference between thrombolytic actions by
      quinapril or perindopril on one hand, and by exogenous Bk on the other was
      longevity of thrombolysis by ACE I and a distinct hypotensive action of exogenous
      Bk. Still, the long-lasting isolated thrombolytic effect of ACE I was mediated
      entirely by endogenous BK as evidenced by the preventive action of icatibant, a
      kinin B2 receptor antagonist. Moreover, in vivo the immediate thrombolysis by
      ACE-I was mediated by PGI2 rather than by NO or t-PA, as shown by pharmacological
      analysis, and by direct blood assays of 6-keto-PGF1 alpha and t-PA antigen.
      Bradykinin as a mediator of pleiotropic endothelial action of several
      cardiovascular drugs (e.g. ACE-I) may complete its mission not only through B2
      receptor and [Ca2+]i--mediated release of PGI2 or NO. Here, we describe a new
      route of the Bk action. Bk mediated induction of the [Ca2+]i-independent, so
      called 'inducible', endothelial isoenzymes required for generation of CO, PGI2
      and PGE2. After 4 hours of incubation of HUVEC with Bk (10 nM) it induced mRNAs
      for haemooxygenase 1 (HO-1), cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2), prostaglandin E synthase
      (PGE-S) whereas mRNA for nitric oxide synthase 2 (NOS-2) was weakly affected. We 
      proved also that unlike in peripheral circulation, in pulmonary circulation only 
      NO but not PGI2 would play a protective role. In the blood-perfused lung,
      endotoxaemia liberates lipids, such as TXA2, PAF and cyst-LTs. These toxic lipids
      along with the activated complement mediate pulmonary damage. Pulmonary
      endothelial nitric oxide is the only local protector against lung injury evoked
      by the phagocytised bacterial lipopolysaccharide. SUMMARY: Summing up, in
      peripheral circulation endogenous Bk is the most efficient activator of
      protective endothelial function. For instance, thrombolytic action of 'tissue
      type' ACE-I depends on the Bk-released PGI2. Acting as an agonist of endothelial 
      B2 kinin receptors Bk rises [Ca2+]i with a subsequent activation of constitutive 
      COX 1 and NOS-3. This is followed by an immediate release of PGI2 and NO.
      Moreover, acting as 'microcytokine' Bk induces mRNAs for HO-1, COX-2 and PGE S,
      the isoenzymes responsible for a delayed endothelial biosynthesis of CO, PGI2 and
      PGE2. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED)

TI  - Acute cellular rejection of human renal tissue by adoptive transfer of allogeneic
      human peripheral blood mononuclear cells into chimeric rats: sequential gene
      expression of cytokines, chemokines and cytolytic effector molecules, and their
      regulation by CTLA-4-Ig.
PG  - 1673-83
AB  - T(h)1- and T(h)2-related cytokines (IFN-gamma, IL-2, IL-4, IL-10),
      beta-chemokines (RANTES, macrophage inflammatory protein-1beta) and their
      receptor [chemotatic cytokine receptor (CCR) 5], and the cytolytic effector
      molecule [Fas ligand (FasL)] play an essential role in regulating and
      co-ordinating acute renal allograft rejection. A chimeric model of acute cellular
      rejection which involves subcapsular grafting of human renal tissue in the
      kidneys of immunodeficient rats and subsequent i.p. infusion of allogeneic human 
      peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) was used to study cellular infiltration
      patterns and sequential intragraft gene expression of these key inflammatory
      mediators. We found that while all molecules are expressed within the human renal
      implant at specific time points following infusion of allogeneic human PBMC, peak
      mRNA expression of IFN-gamma, IL-2, RANTES and CCR5 is associated with a phase of
      human mononuclear infiltration and accumulation, prior to graft destruction
      (induction phase). A short burst of FasL gene expression is found at the end of
      induction and at the onset of graft deterioration. IL-4 mRNA, which is hardly
      detectable, and IL-10 mRNA, which appears early and persists throughout follow-up
      at high levels, both peak after the induction phase with the advent of graft
      destruction. Furthermore, treatment with CTLA-4-Ig, which hardly affects
      migration of human effector cells into graft tissue, is associated with a
      temporary reduction in gene transcript levels for all inflammatory mediators,
      especially IL-2 and IL-4, reduced apoptosis in the graft and amelioration of
      tissue injury. Thus, development of acute cellular rejection in our chimeric
      model involves a co-ordinated pattern of gene expression, in which CTLA-4-Ig
      promotes its effects by transient inactivation of infiltrating human cells.

TI  - Nonrandomized evaluation of pelvic lymph node irradiation in localized carcinoma 
      of the prostate.
PG  - 573-84
AB  - PURPOSE: A great deal of controversy exists regarding the potential benefit of
      pelvic lymph node irradiation compared with treatment to the prostate only in
      patients with localized prostate cancer. Despite numerous reports, including a
      randomized study, this issue has not been completely elucidated. METHODS AND
      MATERIALS: A total of 963 patients with histologically proven localized
      adenocarcinoma of the prostate treated with definitive radiation therapy alone
      were analyzed. Median follow-up was 6.5 years (minimum: 2 years, maximum: 22
      years). Pelvic lymph nodes received 40 to 55 Gy with
      anteroposterior/posteroanterior and sometimes lateral stationary portals in 1.8
      Gy daily fractions; an additional dose was delivered to the prostate with 120
      degrees bilateral are rotation to complete doses of 65 to 68 Gy for Stage A2 and 
      B tumors and 68 to 71 Gy for Stage C tumors. The same total doses were delivered 
      with smaller fields when the prostate only was treated. RESULTS: In Stage A2
      (T1b,c) the 10-year clinical pelvic failure rate was 16% regardless of the volume
      irradiated or tumor differentiation. With Stage B (T2) well- or moderately
      differentiated tumors, the 10-year pelvic failure rates were 22% when pelvic
      lymph nodes were irradiated and 32% when prostate only was irradiated (p = 0.41).
      With Stage A2 (T1b,c) and B (T2) poorly differentiated tumors, the 10-year pelvic
      failure rates were 32% and 7%, respectively (p = 0.72). With clinical stage C
      (T3) well-differentiated tumors treated with 50 to 55 Gy to pelvic lymph nodes,
      the pelvic failure rate was 22% compared with 37% in those receiving 40 to 45 Gy 
      (p < or = 0.07). A significant reduction in pelvic failures was noted with Stage 
      C poorly differentiated tumors when the pelvic lymph nodes received doses higher 
      than 50 Gy (23%) compared with lower doses (46%) (p < or = 0.01). Volume or doses
      of irradiation did not influence incidence of distant metastases in any stage or 
      tumor differentiation group. Disease-free survival did not correlate with volume 
      treated in any clinical stage or tumor differentiation group. In 317 patients on 
      whom pretreatment prostate-specific antigen levels were available, there is a
      suggestion that those treated to the pelvic lymph nodes had a higher chemical
      disease-free survival than those receiving prostate irradiation only. Follow-up
      is short, and differences are not statistically significant in any of the groups.
      Morbidity of therapy was slightly higher in patients treated to the pelvic lymph 
      nodes, but in Stages A2 (T1b,c) and B (T2) differences are not statistically
      significant (4 to 6%). Stage C patients treated to the pelvic lymph nodes with 50
      Gy had a 12% incidence of Grade 2 rectosigmoid morbidity compared with 6% in
      those treated with 40 Gy (p = 0.26). CONCLUSIONS: In this retrospective analysis,
      pelvic lymph node irradiation did not influence local/pelvic tumor control,
      incidence of distant metastases, or disease-free survival in patients with
      clinical Stage A2 (T1b,c) or B (T2) localized carcinoma of the prostate. In
      patients with Stage C (T3) disease, irradiation of the pelvic lymph nodes with
      doses of 50 to 55 Gy resulted in a lower incidence of pelvic recurrences and
      improved disease-free survival. Morbidity of therapy was acceptable, although
      patients with Stage C disease had a somewhat higher incidence of Grade 2
      rectosigmoid morbidity. Pelvic lymph node irradiation is being elucidated in
      properly designed prospective, randomized protocols.

TI  - Short-term effects of intrathecal baclofen in spasticity.
PG  - 165-72
AB  - Six patients with long-lasting spasticity resistant to different drug therapies
      including oral baclofen received a bolus injection of lumbar intrathecal
      baclofen. Electromyographic (EMG) reactions of leg muscles (soleus, tibialis
      anterior, quadriceps, and hamstrings) to standard stimuli and during attempts at 
      voluntary activation were recorded before the drug injection and up to 3 h after 
      the injection. Responses to joint movements, H-reflexes, ankle clonus, and
      defensive reactions were noticeably suppressed within 30-45 min after the
      injection and had practically disappeared after 2 h. Ankle clonus was seen only
      in patients with H-reflexes, and clonus disappeared when the reflex responses to 
      the n. tibialis stimuli were absent. A decrease in clonus EMG burst amplitudes
      was accompanied by a decrease in the clonus frequency. These observations favor
      the autooscillation hypothesis of clonus. Baclofen injection led to improvement
      in selective voluntary activation of leg muscles in patients with residual motor 
      control. These results suggest that execution of voluntary motor commands in the 
      patients suffered from functionally abnormal spinal circuitry rather than from
      changes in the descending motor commands. Intrathecal baclofen appears to be an
      effective way of eliminating increased muscle tone and spasms which can allow for
      voluntary motor function when it is present.

TI  - Redirection of prostaglandin endoperoxide metabolism at the platelet-vascular
      interface in man.
PG  - 380-5
AB  - Prostacyclin (PGI2) is an inhibitor of platelet function in vitro. We tested the 
      hypothesis that PGI2 is formed in biologically active concentrations at the
      platelet-vascular interface in man and can be pharmacologically modulated to
      enhance its inhibitory properties. This became feasible when we developed a
      microquantitative technique that permits the measurement of eicosanoids in
      successive 40-microliters aliquots of whole blood emerging from a bleeding time
      wound. In 13 healthy volunteers the rate of production of thromboxane B2 (TXB2)
      gradually increased, reaching a maximum of 421 +/- 90 (mean +/- SEM)
      fg/microliters per s at 300 +/- 20 s. The hydration product of PGI2, 6-keto-PGF1 
      alpha, rose earlier and to a lesser degree, reaching a peak (68 +/- 34
      fg/microliters per s) at 168 +/- 23 s. The generation of prostaglandins PGE2 and 
      D2 resembled that of PGI2. Whereas the threshold concentration of PGI2 for an
      effect on platelets in vitro is approximately 30 fg/microliters, only less than 3
      fg/microliters circulates under physiological conditions. By contrast, peak
      concentrations of 6-keto-PGF1 alpha obtained locally after vascular damage
      averaged 305 fg/microliters. Pharmacological regulation of PG endoperoxide
      metabolism at the platelet-vascular interface was demonstrated by administration 
      of a TX synthase inhibitor. The rate of production of PGI2, PGE2, and PGD2
      increased coincident with inhibition of TXA, as reflected by three indices; the
      concentration of TXB2 in bleeding time blood and serum, and excretion of the
      urinary metabolite, 2,3-dinor-TXB2. These studies indicate that PGI2 is formed
      locally in biologically effective concentrations at the site of vessel injury and
      provide direct evidence in support of transcellular metabolism of PG
      endoperoxides in man.

TI  - Leukotrienes, allergy and inflammation.
PG  - 165-71
AB  - Immunological and non-immunological injury induce as a result of the action of
      the enzyme lipoxygenase the release of a series of arachidonic acid metabolites
      known as leukotrienes. The leukotrienes play an important role in allergic and
      inflammatory disease. Leukotrienes C4, D4 and E4 which recently have been
      recognized as constituents of the allergic mediator slow reacting substance of
      anaphylaxis (SRS-A) induce powerful bronchoconstriction, plasma exudation and
      weal and flare responses. Leukotriene B4 is involved in the regulation of
      chemotaxis, chemokinesis and other aspects of both cellular and vascular
      inflammation. The development of specific lipoxygenase inhibitors may lead to a
      new class of drugs for the treatment of bronchial asthma and chronic inflammatory
      diseases.
