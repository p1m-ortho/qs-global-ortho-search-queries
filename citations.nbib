AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of preoperative percutaneous drainage in
      lumbar tuberculosis with psoas abscess, through compare the clinical efficacy of 
      two different methods. METHODS: Thirty-six patients with lumbar tuberculosis
      complicated with psoas abscess in corresponding with the inclusion criteria were 
      admitted in Zhejiang Province Traditional Chinese Medicine Hospital from January 
      2015 to January 2017. The patients were divided into group A and group B
      according to the different therapeutic methods. All patients were given the
      standard anti tuberculosis treatment, and percutaneous catheter drainage was used
      in group A after admission immediately for psoas abscess before operation, while 
      group B with no special treatment. At 3 weeks after anti tuberculosis treatment, 
      2 patients were excluded in group B, which had to postpone operation because of
      no reduction in erythrocyte sedimentation rate(ESR) and C reactive protein(CRP). 
      Finally 34 patients were enrolled in this study. There were 18 cases in group A, 
      including 10 males and 8 females, aged from 24 to 73 years old with an average
      of(42.5+/-10.2) years. There were 16 cases in group B, including 9 males and 7
      females, aged from 23 to 75 years old with an average of(42.3+/-9.8) years. All
      patients were treated with posterior pedicle screw fixation, anterior debridement
      and bone graft fusion. Anterior surgery bleeding volume, operation time, anterior
      incision length, postoperative anus exhaust time, VAS score, Cobb angle, ESR, CRP
      changes and postoperative sinus formation were compared between two groups.
      RESULTS: All patients were followed up for 6 to 21 months with an average of 13
      months. At the last follow-up, no mixed infection, tuberculosis recurrence,
      pedicle screw loosening and nail withdrawal were found. The average operative
      time, anterior surgery bleeding volume and anterior incision length of group A
      were less than that of group B(P<0.05). Postoperative anal exhaust time of group 
      A was lower than that of group B(P<0.05). Improvement degree of ESR, CRP at 3
      weeks after anti tuberculosis and 1 week after operation, group A was better than
      group B(P<0.05), and there was no significant difference between two groups in 1 
      month and 6 months after operation(P>0.05). There was 1 case sinus formation in
      group A and 5 cases in group B, there was significant difference in sinus
      formation rate between two groups (P<0.05). VAS score and Cobb angle at 1 month
      after operation was obvious improved(P<0.05), but there was no significant
      difference between two groups (P>0.05). Spinal cord nerve injury was obvious
      improved after operation, but there was no significant difference between two
      groups. CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative percutaneous catheter drainage is a safe and
      feasible method for the treatment of lumbar tuberculosis with psoas abscess. It
      can increase the effect of anti tuberculosis before operation, reduce the
      surgical trauma and reduce the incidence of postoperative complications. It can
      be recommended in clinical application.

TI  - Six versus 12 Months of Anti Tubercular Therapy in Patients With Biopsy Proven
      Spinal Tuberculosis: A Single Center, Open Labeled, Prospective Randomized
      Clinical Trial-A Pilot study.
PG  - E1-E6
LID - 10.1097/BRS.0000000000002811 [doi]
AB  - STUDY DESIGN: A single center pilot study, open labeled, prospective randomized
      clinical trial. OBJECTIVE: To compare six versus 12 months of anti TB therapy in 
      patients with biopsy proven spinal TB. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: There is no
      clear consensus or evidence based guidelines for the duration of treatment of
      spinal tuberculosis. We studied if 6 and 12 months of anti tubercular therapy
      (ATT) had equivalent outcomes at 24 months from completion of therapy. METHODS: A
      prospective randomized open labeled clinical trial of 6 versus 12 months ATT in
      patients with biopsy proven spinal-vertebral tuberculosis. The primary end point 
      was absence of recurrence 24 months after completing therapy. Secondary end
      points were clinical cure at the end of therapy, significant adverse effect of
      ATT, need for delayed surgery, and residual neurological dysfunction. RESULTS:
      Hundred patients, randomized to 6 or 12 months ATT, were followed up for a
      minimum of 24 months from completion of therapy. All patients completed scheduled
      duration of ATT, with one crossover from 6 months ATT group to 12 months. There
      were no recurrences of disease on the 24 months follow up following completion of
      ATT. All 100 patients met criteria for cure at time of stopping medicines. One
      patient (12 months group) had residual neurological dysfunction at the time of
      stopping treatment, which completely resolved over the next 12 months.There were 
      no patients with major drug induced hepatitis. One patient (12 months group)
      needed percutaneous drainage of an abscess. None needed surgical re-exploration
      for persistent infection of implant removal. CONCLUSION: This pilot study
      concludes that, in patients with biopsy proven spinal-vertebral, TB, 6 and 12
      months of ATT give similar clinical outcomes at 24 months of completion of
      therapy. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 2.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the clinical efficacy of cortical bone trajectory (CBT)
      screws in the treatment of elderly patients with lumbar spinal tuberculosis.
      METHODS: A total of 45 elderly patients with lumbar spinal tuberculosis were
      allocated to 1 groups based on different surgical methods: 22 patients in group A
      received posterior CBT screw fixation combined with anterior debridement with a
      small incision and bone grafting, and 23 patients in group B underwent posterior 
      pedicle screw fixation combined with anterior debridement with a small incision
      and bone grafting. The intraoperative blood loss, postoperative drainage volumes,
      Cobb angles, visual analogue scale scores, erythrocyte sedimentation rates
      (ESRs), and Frankel grades before and after surgery were analyzed. The surgical
      complications and spinal fusion were also assessed. RESULTS: After a 3-month
      follow-up, 2 patients in group A and 3 patients in group B experienced anterior
      psoas muscle abscesses, which were cured by a second surgery. The remaining
      patients were healed by the first surgery. Spinal fusion after bone graft
      required 3 to 8 months (average, 4.9 months). There were no significant
      differences in surgery time, blood loss, drainage volume, and hospital stay
      between the 2 groups. The visual analogue scale scores, Cobb angles, ESRs, and
      Frankel grades were significantly improved after surgery in both groups.
      CONCLUSION: The CBT screws were not inferior to traditional pedicle screws. The
      application of CBT- screws fixation combined with anterior debridement with a
      small incision and bone grafting was an effective and safe method to treat
      elderly patients with lumbar spinal tuberculosis.

TI  - Cauda equina syndrome following an uneventful spinal anesthesia in a patient
      undergoing drainage of the Bartholin abscess: A case report.
PG  - e0693
LID - 10.1097/MD.0000000000010693 [doi]
AB  - RATIONALE: Neuraxial anesthesia is a commonly used type of regional anesthesia.
      Cauda equina syndrome is an unusual and severe complication of neuraxial
      anesthesia, and is caused by damage to the sacral roots of the neural canal. We
      present a case of cauda equina syndrome following spinal anesthesia in a patient 
      who underwent Bartholin abscess drainage. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 23-year old female 
      scheduled to undergo surgical drainage of Bartholin abscess. Spinal anesthesia
      was performed with bupivacaine and fentanyl. There were no perioperative adverse 
      events reported. On postoperative day 1, the patient went to the emergency
      department describing bilateral weakness and pain of the lower extremities (LE). 
      DIAGNOSES: Lumbar magnetic resonance imaging showed increased gadolinium
      accumulation in the neural sheath at the level of the cauda equina tracts,
      consistent with the diagnosis of arachnoiditis and the diagnosis of cauda equina 
      was established. INTERVENTIONS: The patient received the following emergent
      treatment: 75 mg pregabalin (oral) every 12 hours, 20 mg (8 drops) tramadol
      (oral) every 8 hours, and 4 mg dexamethasone (intravenous) every 6 hours. On
      postoperative day 4, the patient still experienced bilateral flaccid paraparesis 
      (accentuated in the left side), neuropathic pain in low extremities, and left
      brachial monoparesis. Hence, dexamethasone was instantly replaced with 1 g
      methylprednisolone (intravenous) for 5 days. OUTCOMES: After completing 5 days of
      methylprednisolone, on postoperative day 9, the patient experienced less pain in 
      left extremities, osteotendinous reflexes were slightly diminished, and she was
      able to walk with difficulty for 3 to 5 minutes. Greater mobility was evidenced, 
      with right proximal and distal low extremities Medical Research Council Scale
      grades of 2 and 3 and left proximal and distal low extremities Medical Research
      Council Scale grades 1 and 2, respectively. Oral prednisone was restarted.
      Consequently, she was discharged home in stable conditions on postoperative day
      25 with a prescription for sertraline, clonazepam, pregabalin, paracetamol, and
      prednisone. LESSON: The early detection and treatment of complications after
      neuraxial anesthesia is essential to minimize the risk of permanent damage.

AB  - Acute hematogenous bone and joint infections (osteomyelitis, septic arthritis,
      osteoarthritis, and spondylodiscitis) affect more frequently children younger
      than 5 years of age. Early diagnosis and prompt treatment are needed to limit the
      risk of complications. Children with suspected bone and joint infections (BJI)
      should be hospitalized at the beginning of treatment. Surgical drainage is
      indicated in patients with septic arthritis and in those with periosteal abscess.
      Staphylococcus aureus is involved in BJIs in children at all ages; Kingella
      kingae is a very common causative pathogen in children under 4 years of age. The 
      French Pediatric Infectious Disease Group recommends in children > 3 months of
      age empirical antibiotic therapy with appropriate coverage against
      methicillin-sensitive S. aureus with high doses (150mg/kg/day) of intravenous
      amoxicillin-clavulanate, cefuroxime or cefazoline. In most children with
      uncomplicated BJI, short intravenous antibiotic therapy for 3 days can be
      followed by oral therapy. The minimum total duration of antibiotic therapy should
      be 10 days for septic arthritis and 3 weeks for osteomyelitis.

TI  - A Case Report of Refractory Notalgia Paresthetica Treated with Lidocaine
      Infusions.
PG  - 1225-1228
AB  - BACKGROUND Notalgia paresthetica is a neuropathic condition that manifests as a
      chronic itch in the thoraco-dorsal region. It is often resistant to treatment,
      and specific guidelines for its management are lacking. As such, we present a
      treatment approach with intravenous lidocaine infusions. CASE REPORT The case
      involves a 50-year-old woman with spinal cord injury caused by an epidural
      abscess. The patient developed notalgia paresthetica and sublesional neuropathic 
      pain following its drainage. In the course of her pain management, she was
      treated with intravenous lidocaine which resulted in profound relief of notalgia 
      paresthetica. CONCLUSIONS Intravenous lidocaine was effective in relieving
      neuropathic itch in the patient case presented.

TI  - Comparison of the Anteroposterior and Posterior Approaches for Percutaneous
      Catheter Drainage of Tuberculous Psoas Abscess.
PG  - 5374-5381
AB  - BACKGROUND Tuberculous infection of the lumbar spine may be associated with psoas
      abscess. The aim of this clinical study was to compare the outcome of posterior
      lumbar debridement and spinal fusion, combined with either a one-stage
      anteroposterior (AP) or posterior (P) approach to percutaneous catheter drainage 
      (PCD) for the treatment of lumbar tuberculosis with psoas abscess. MATERIAL AND
      METHODS From January 2008 to June 2012, 74 patients were diagnosed at our
      hospital with lumbar tuberculosis with unilateral or bilateral psoas abscess.
      Forty-three patients underwent P-PCD (group A), and 31 patients underwent AP-PCD 
      (group B). Operative duration, blood loss, the length of hospital stay, spinal
      correction, clinical cure rate, and other clinical outcomes in the two groups
      were compared. RESULTS Comparison of the outcome for the P-PCD and AP-PCD
      patients showed that there was no significant difference in outcome for spinal
      bone fusion, correction of spinal deformity, or cure rate from tuberculosis
      infection (P>0.05). Blood loss, operative time, and the length of hospital stay
      for patients in group A, the P-PCD group, were significantly less than for group 
      B, the AP-PCD group (P<0.05). Also, group B, the AP-PCD group, had an increased
      incidence of complications than group A, the P-PCD group, leading to increased
      hospital stay (OR 3.04, CI 0.52-17.75). CONCLUSIONS For the treatment of
      tuberculous psoas abscess using PCD, the posterior approach may achieve the same 
      clinical efficacy as the anteroposterior approach, but is associated with reduced
      length of hospital stay, and lower risk of complications.

LID - 10.2169/internalmedicine.9050-17 [doi]
AB  - Pneumothorax secondary to septic pulmonary embolism (SPE) is rare but
      life-threatening. We herein report a long-term hemodialysis patient with psoas
      abscess caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, associated with
      other muscle and splenic abscesses and SPE. Intravenous vancomycin treatment and 
      percutaneous drainage of the psoas abscess rapidly improved her condition.
      However, the SPE lesions continued to increase, and right-sided pneumothorax
      occurred 10 days after treatment. The pneumothorax resolved after two months and 
      SPE and all abscesses after four months of treatment. Since late-onset
      pneumothorax caused by SPE can occur despite successful treatment of the primary 
      infection, care should be taken with such patients.

TI  - Treatment of Lumbar Tuberculosis by Mini-Open Anterior Approach Focal Cleaning
      Combined with Posterior Internal Fixation.
PG  - 4158-4165
AB  - BACKGROUND The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficiency and clinical
      outcomes of mini-open anterior approach focal cleaning combined with posterior
      internal fixation compared to conventional anterior extraperitoneal approach
      focal cleaning combined with posterior internal fixation in the treatment of
      lumbar tuberculosis (TB). MATERIAL AND METHODS Medical records from 124 patients 
      were collected from February 2010 to April 2015; patients were divided into two
      groups: group A (mini-open anterior approach focal cleaning combined with
      posterior internal fixation) and group B (conventional anterior extraperitoneal
      approach focal cleaning combined with posterior internal fixation in period I).
      The data on postoperative mechanical ventilation time, preoperative,
      postoperative, and last follow-up Cobb angle, visual analog scale (VAS),
      erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and Frankel classification were collected
      and analyzed. Operative complications, internal stability, and bone graft fusion 
      were also observed. RESULTS All patients were followed-up for 12 to 36 months
      (average 22.5 months). Seven cases (five in group A and two in group B) had side 
      psoas abscess and were cured after secondary drainage surgery. The rest of the
      cases were all cured after primary surgery, with no formation of sinus,
      incisional hernia, cerebrospinal fluid leakage, or recurrence of spinal TB, with 
      no TB symptoms. Bone graft fusion ranged from 3 to 8 months (average 4.7 months).
      Compared to group B, group A, which had less time on postoperative mechanical
      ventilation, had a higher VAS score. Both groups had distinct improvements in
      Cobb angle, ESR, and Frankel classification after surgery. CONCLUSIONS Treating
      lumbar TB by mini-open anterior approach focal cleaning combined with posterior
      internal fixation was safe and effective.

AB  - A 43-year-old Japanese woman was evaluated in the outpatient department for right
      shoulder pain and fever, which began 5 days earlier. MRI of the right shoulder
      revealed a high-intensity area deep in the right trapezius muscle. Aspiration
      revealed purulent fluid, and Gram staining of the fluid showed Gram-negative
      bacilli. The patient was also found to be profoundly anaemic and to have a
      positive urine pregnancy test. On admission, we initiated intravenous
      ampicillin-sulbactam and aztreonam. She underwent dilatation and curettage for
      septic abortion and surgical drainage of the right shoulder abscess. Bacteroides 
      fragilis was isolated from the blood, uterine aspiration and abscess samples. On 
      hospital day 4, a whole-body CT scan revealed no other abscesses, and
      ampicillin-sulbactam was continued for 28 days. The patient was discharged on
      hospital day 29. Gram staining is an important tool for evaluating infectious
      aetiologies.

AB  - Tuberculous cold abscesses are a rare and unusual form of extrapulmonary
      tuberculosis. We here report the case of a 27-year old patient with a 5-month
      history of left dorsolumbar swelling presenting with dorsolumbar cold abscess
      revealing Pott's disease without neurological complications. Examination of pus
      sample collected at the time the abscess was incised and drained helped to
      confirm the diagnosis of cold abscesses of TB origin. The patient underwent 12
      months of anti-tuberculosis treatment which lead to a faster recovery; the
      sequelae was slight gibbosity.

AB  - A middle-aged man was admitted with worsening hip pain, fevers and reduced
      mobility. These symptoms were preceded by a mechanical fall but despite regular
      analgesia, symptoms did not resolve. His prior medical history included ischaemic
      heart disease, hypertension and hypercholesterolaemia. A trauma and orthopaedic
      review revealed a painful left hip with reduced range of motion. In addition,
      some mild tenderness in the left iliac fossa was noted. Blood tests revealed
      markedly raised inflammatory markers. Plain radiographs and ultrasound were
      normal. MRI scan found a massive left iliopsoas collection secondary to
      perforated diverticular disease of the sigmoid colon. The patient was managed
      with intravenous antibiotics and the collection was drained percutaneously.
      Approximately 500 mL of pus was aspirated. The patient made an excellent recovery
      with interval imaging showing a reduction in the collection size.

AB  - We describe the case of a 67-year-old male with liver cirrhosis who presented
      with fever and neck pain. Magnetic resonance imaging of the spine detected
      cervical vertebral osteomyelitis, and enhanced CT of the neck and spine revealed 
      retropharyngeal abscess. The patient was treated with empirical antimicrobial
      therapy and surgical drainage due to significant airway involvement. Escherichia 
      coli was cultured from the blood and pus in inferior cervical vertebrae which was
      a rare pathogen. Haematogenous spread may have resulted in cervical vertebral
      osteomyelitis and retropharyngeal abscess. With high mortality rates, early
      diagnosis of retropharyngeal abscess is required to avoid debilitating
      complications such as airway obstruction.

TI  - Treatment Challenges of Prosthetic Hip Infection with Associated Iliacus Muscle
      Abscess: Report of 5 Cases and Literature Review.
PG  - 127-135
LID - 10.7150/jbji.16429 [doi]
AB  - Prosthetic joint infection is an unfortunate though well-recognized complication 
      of total joint arthroplasty. An iliacus and/or iliopsoas muscle abscess is a
      rarely documented presentation of hip prosthetic joint infection. It is thought
      an unrecognized retroperitoneal nidus of infection can be a source of continual
      seeding of the prosthetic hip joint, prolonging attempts to eradicate infection
      despite aggressive debridement and explant attempts. The current study presents
      five cases demonstrating this clinical scenario, and discusses various treatment 
      challenges. In each case we report the patient's clinical history, pertinent
      imaging, management and outcome. Diagnosis of the iliacus muscle abscess was made
      using computed tomography imaging. In brief, the mean number of total drainage
      procedures (open and percutaneous) per patient was 4.2, and outcomes consisted of
      one patient with a hip girdlestone, two patients with delayed revisions, and two 
      patients with retained prosthesis. All patients ended with functional pain and on
      oral antibiotic suppression with an average follow up of 18 months. This article 
      highlights an iliacus muscle abscess as an unrecognized source of infection to a 
      prosthetic hip. It demonstrates resilience to standard treatment protocols for
      prosthetic hip infection, and is associated with poor patient outcomes.
      Aggressive surgical debridement appears to remain critical to treatment success, 
      and early retroperitoneal debridement of the abscess should be considered.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Tuberculous involvement of the spinal cord parenchyma is an
      exceedingly rare clinical entity; even more so is concurrent intracranial
      tuberculosis (TB). Spinal intramedullary TB presents with a characteristic
      subacute myelopathy, with slowly progressive paraplegia, sensory deficits, and/or
      bowel and bladder dysfunction. Diagnosis is strongly suspected with a clinical
      history of known TB in conjunction with characteristic findings on magnetic
      resonance imaging. Management involves multiagent antitubercular chemotherapy
      without or with operative intervention. CASE DESCRIPTION: We present a case of a 
      9-month-old boy with a retrospectively recognized history of pulmonary TB
      presenting with fever and back tenderness found to have lower-extremity
      hypertonia and clonus. Imaging revealed concurrent intracranial and spinal
      intramedullary tuberculomas. The patient was treated for hydrocephalus with
      external ventricular drainage followed by T8-T10 laminectomy, drainage of
      abscess, and duraplasty. Parietal lobe biopsies proved the tuberculous etiology
      of intracranial lesions. CONCLUSION: Etiopathogenesis, diagnosis, and management 
      considerations of spinal intramedullary tuberculosis are reviewed and discussed.

PG  - e146-e149
LID - 10.5546/aap.2017.e146 [doi]
AB  - Spinal epidural abscess is an uncommon pathology. It has an incidence of one case
      per 100 000 individuals. An increase is observed due to the raise of risk factors
      such as diabetes mellitus, spinal abnormalities, tattoos, acupuncture, epidural
      analgesia, and a greater availability of imaging methods. It is a purulent
      collection located between the dura and the medullary canal. The most common
      germs are Staphylococcus aureus and Gram-negative bacteria. Without timely
      treatment, it evolves to medullary compression and permanent neurological
      sequelae. An 11-year-old girl was admitted with fever of 48 hs evolution, left
      lower back pain, antalgic gait with lumbar stiffness. Neurological examination
      was normal. Blunt blistering lesions were observed on lower limbs. Magnetic
      resonance imaging showed an image compatible with spinal epidural abscess. The
      evolutionwas favorable. Treatment consisted of surgical drainage and antibiotics 
      for 6 weeks. From the culture of the material obtained, methidllin-sensitive
      Staphylococcus aureus was isolated.

TI  - A spinal epidural abscess due to Streptobacillus moniliformis infection following
      a rat bite: case report.
PG  - 92-96
LID - 10.3171/2016.12.SPINE161042 [doi]
AB  - The authors describe the case of a 40-year-old man suffering from an epidural
      abscess in the thoracic spine due to a rarely isolated pathogen, Streptobacillus 
      moniliformis, the causative agent of rat bite fever. Besides diffuse abdominal
      pain, ataxia, paresthesia, hypesthesia, and enhanced reflexes of the lower
      extremities, the patient suffered from a decreased sensation of bladder filling. 
      His history was also positive for a rat bite 6 weeks earlier. Magnetic resonance 
      imaging showed an epidural, space-occupying lesion compressing the spinal cord at
      the vertebral levels of T6-8. Neurosurgery revealed an epidural abscess, which
      was drained via laminectomy (T-7) and excision of the ligamentum flavum (T6-8).
      The etiological agent S. moniliformis was identified by 16S rRNA-based polymerase
      chain reaction and sequencing as well as by culture and mass spectrometry.
      Treatment with penicillin G led to complete resolution of the abscess and
      clinical recovery of the patient, who regained his bladder-filling sensation and 
      free walking ability. This case demonstrates that careful attention to the
      patient's history is essential in suspecting unusual bacterial pathogens as the
      cause of an epidural abscess and initiating the optimal diagnostic procedure and 
      antimicrobial therapy.

LID - 10.23736/S0390-5616.16.03185-X [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Spinal epidural abscess (SEA) is a rarely encountered clinical entity
      during the course of Brucella infection. METHODS: We reported 17 patients
      diagnosed with Brucellar SEA for a mean follow-up of 15 months. Spinal epidural
      abscess was detected by magnetic resonance imaging in all cases. Brucella
      diagnosis was established by serological tests. Patients were administered
      antibiotics for duration of 6 to 16 weeks. RESULTS: SEA was localized in lumbar
      region in 9 patients, thoracic in 4 patients, cervical in 3 patients, both
      thoracic and lumbar in 1 patient. Neurologic examination was normal in 4
      patients, we detected motor and/or sensory deficit in 13 patients. Symptoms
      regressed in all patients after the institution of antibiotic regimens, and all
      recovered fully. Surgical drainage of abscess was performed in 2 patients and 3
      patients were performed limited laminectomies. CONCLUSIONS: Antibiotic therapy
      could be primary treatment and is effective in required doses and duration for
      many patients. If neurologic deterioration be observed despite proper antibiotic 
      regimens in required doses and duration, surgical intervention is to be
      performed.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Choosing Wisely Canada (CWC) is an initiative to encourage
      patient-physician discussions about the appropriate, evidence based use of
      medical tests, procedures and treatments. We present the Canadian Association of 
      Emergency Physicians' (CAEP) top five list of recommendations, and the process
      undertaken to generate them. METHODS: The CAEP Expert Working Group (EWG)
      generated a candidate list of 52 tests, procedures, and treatments in emergency
      medicine whose value to care was questioned. This list was distributed to CAEP
      committee chairs, revised, and then divided and randomly allocated to 107
      Canadian emergency physicians (EWG nominated) who voted on each item based on:
      action-ability, effectiveness, safety, economic burden, and frequency of use. The
      EWG discussed the items with the highest votes, and generated the recommendations
      by consensus. RESULTS: The top five CAEP CWC recommendations are: 1) Don't order 
      CT head scans in adults and children who have suffered minor head injuries
      (unless positive for a validated head injury clinical decision rule); 2) Don't
      prescribe antibiotics in adults with bronchitis/asthma and children with
      bronchiolitis; 3) Don't order lumbosacral spinal imaging in patients with
      non-traumatic low back pain who have no red flags/pathologic indicators; 4) Don't
      order neck radiographs in patients who have a negative examination using the
      Canadian C-spine rules; and 5) Don't prescribe antibiotics after incision and
      drainage of uncomplicated skin abscesses unless extensive cellulitis exists.
      CONCLUSIONS: The CWC recommendations for emergency medicine were selected using a
      mixed methods approach. This top 5 list was released at the CAEP Conference in
      June 2015 and should form the basis for future implementation efforts.

      With Individualized Chemotherapy.

LID - 10.3928/01477447-20170117-02 [doi]
AB  - The goal of this study was to investigate the effect of individualized
      chemotherapy delivered via percutaneous catheter drainage on paravertebral
      abscesses in spinal tuberculosis (TB). Data from 48 patients with spinal TB with 
      paravertebral abscesses who received individualized chemotherapy via computed
      tomography-guided catheterization between 2009 and 2012 were retrospectively
      analyzed. The paravertebral abscesses affected the thoracic vertebra (n=12), the 
      lumbar spine (n=20), the thoracolumbar vertebra (n=10), and the lumbosacral
      (n=6). All patients achieved clinical healing with no recurrence. Erythrocyte
      sedimentation rate and visual analog scale scores decreased significantly by the 
      endpoint of follow-up. Although C-reactive protein values increased slightly
      right after treatment, they were also significantly lower at last follow-up. The 
      kyphotic angle and Oswestry Disability Index values also exhibited significant
      decreases. No neurologic function impairment was reported. Computed
      tomography-guided catheterization for continuous administration of individualized
      chemotherapy was a safe and effective treatment for spinal TB with paravertebral 
      abscesses in the cohort examined, and thus, it warrants further study.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Thai aims of this study were to provide an epidemiological and
      microbiological analysis of psoas abscess in the human immunodeficiency virus
      (HIV)-infected population, and to describe the optimal investigative and
      management approach of this condition. METHODS: A retrospective chart analysis of
      20 patients with a diagnosis of psoas abscess admitted to a regional academic
      hospital from January 2012 to December 2014 was performed. RESULTS: Twenty
      patients with psoas abscess were identified, of which 14 were HIV positive (70%) 
      and five HIV negative (25%). One patient remained untested (5%). The mean CD4
      count was 402 cells/mL (range 150-796 cells/mL, median 367 cells/mL). Acid fast
      bacilli were positive in psoas abscess aspirates in 13 cases (65%).
      Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli were identified in 15% of cases. The
      radioisotope bone scan showed increased vertebral uptake in 10 patients (62.5%), 
      with the lumbar spine (L1-L4) being most commonly involved (31%). There was a
      statistically significant increase in radioisotope uptake in the lumbar vertebrae
      in tuberculous psoas abscess than in pyogenic psoas abscess (p=0.003).
      Ultrasound-guided percutaneous drainage was used in 16 patients (80%) with a
      success rate of 87.5%; only two cases required repeat drainage (12.5%). Open
      drainage was used in four patients (30%) with a 100% success rate. There were no 
      mortalities at 30-day follow-up. CONCLUSION: Tuberculous psoas abscess from
      underlying vertebral osteomyelitis is more common than pyogenic psoas abscess.
      Ultrasound has high diagnostic accuracy and guides percutaneous drainage with
      excellent success rates. Ultrasound-guided percutaneous drainage should be
      regarded as the first-line therapeutic modality.

TI  - When Do You Drain Epidural Abscesses of the Spine?
PG  - 374-378
AB  - BACKGROUND: How the relative volume of an epidural abscess on MRI affects
      outcomes with antibiotics alone has limited literature. The purpose of this study
      was to identify which infected epidural collections will reabsorb with
      antibiotics alone. Specifically, what is the critical size and enhancement on
      contrast MRIs to require a drainage procedure? MATERIALS AND METHODS: A
      retrospective review of all spinal osteomyelitis patients from 2001-2012 was
      performed. Inclusion criteria included appropriate initial imaging, lab results, 
      no drainage procedures of collections, and no treatment prior to admission at an 
      outside institution. Large size epidural abscess was defined as abscesses with a 
      volume greater than 1400 mm3. Clearance and mortality rates were evaluated.
      RESULTS: The cohort consisted of 128 patients including 76 men and 52 women who
      had a mean age of 62 years (range, 21 to 90 years) and had a mean follow-up of 38
      months (range, 24 to 72 months). Patients with a large epidural abscess had a
      greater clearance rate of the infection and decreased mortality rate when treated
      with surgery or drainage compared to patients treated with antibiotics alone
      [clearance: p=0.048; mortality: p=0.048]. Those small epidural abscesses had
      similar clearance and mortality rates when treated with surgery or drainage
      compared to antibiotics alone [clearance: p=0.75; mortality: p=0.13]. Patients
      with non-enhancing epidural abscesses had similar clearance rates-but increased
      mortality rates-when treated with antibiotics alone compared to surgery or
      drainage [clearance: p>0.9; mortality: p=0.03]. Those with enhancing epidural
      collections had similar clearance and mortality rates when treated with
      antibiotics alone compared to surgery or drainage [clearance: p=0.08, mortality: 
      p=0.10]. CONCLUSION: Large epidural infected collections require surgery or a
      percutaneous drainage procedure. Clearance rates are higher and mortality rates
      are lower compared to non-operative management in these instances. Neurologically
      intact patients with a small epidural collection can be treated with antibiotics 
      alone with good expected outcomes.

TI  - Acute transverse myelitis of the cervical spine secondary to psoas abscess.
PG  - 579
AB  - BACKGROUND: Acute transverse myelitis is uncommon and presumably results from an 
      autoimmune process or a preceding infection. Most cases of bacterial myelitis are
      due to hematogenous dissemination from urinary or respiratory tract infections or
      contiguous spreading from a neighboring infected structure. A psoas abscess
      rarely spreads to higher levels of the spinal cord. No cases of acute cervical
      myelitis due to a psoas abscess have been previously reported. CASE PRESENTATION:
      A 34-year-old man was transferred to our hospital due to progressive muscle
      weakness, sensory deficits and severe hypotension. Two weeks prior to admission, 
      he had received low back injection to relieve back pain in a healthcare clinic.
      One day prior to admission, his condition had worsened. On admission, he was
      tetraplegic with absence of sensation below the level of the suprasternal fossa. 
      A lumbar CT scan demonstrated an abscess in the left psoas, and the magnetic
      resonance imaging (MRI) scan of the entire spinal suggested a cervical spine
      infection. A cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis performed before surgery
      indicated the possibility of bacterial infection. An operation was performed to
      drain the abscess. Microbiological cultivation revealed a Methicillin-resistant
      Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infection. The patient was administered with
      vancomycin for 10 days and followed by oral formulations of linezolid for 6
      weeks. The patient's general condition improved, and he was successfully
      discharged. Six months later, a follow-up MRI revealed that the lesion of the
      cervical spine had been ameliorated, and the sensation and myodynamia of his
      upper limbs had partially recovered. CONCLUSION: This was a rare case of a
      high-level cervical spine pyogenic infection complicating psoas abscess. An
      invasive paravertebral injection procedure was thought to be the initial damaging
      event that created a port of entry for MRSA into the psoas muscle and caused a
      subsequent psoas abscess. This case indicated that evaluation of higher levels of
      the spine is warranted when a psoas abscess coexists with severe weakness.

AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of minimally invasive spinal
      decompression combined with local chemotherapy in treating patients with
      thoracic/lumbar tuberculosis (TB) and abscess compression of the spinal canal.
      Clinical data of 31 patients with thoracic/lumbar TB and spinal epidural abscess,
      admitted to our hospital between December 2005 and June 2014 were retrospectively
      analyzed. All patients received initial conservative treatment but achieved
      unsatisfactory results and then underwent minimally invasive spinal canal
      decompression, focus debridement and catheter drainage through a posterior
      interlaminar approach. Postoperatively, a short-course (1-2months) of local
      chemotherapy was given. The patients were followed up on a regular basis. The
      neurologic status was graded according to the American Spinal Injury Association 
      (ASIA) score system. Kyphotic deformity was evaluated using Cobb angle
      measurement. Patients were followed up for an average of 37months (range:
      12-96months). At the last follow-up, ASIA scores were improved in all patients,
      and there was a mild increase in the Cobb angle, but satisfactory spinal
      stabilization was achieved. Hepatorenal function, erythrocyte sedimentation rate 
      and C-reactive protein levels all returned to normal. One complication was
      observed, where the patient had worsened deficit postoperatively but achieved a
      satisfactory recovery (from Grade C to Grade E) one year after a second surgery. 
      Minimally invasive spinal canal decompression combined with local chemotherapy
      appears to be an effective treatment for patients with thoracic/lumbar TB and
      abscess compression in the spinal canal.

AB  - We present a rare case with primary tubercular involvement of the foot,
      accomapanied by a reactionary (aseptic) effusion in the knee. The diagnosis was
      delayed due to unusual presentation and also because of failure to elicit a
      detailed history. Incision and drainage of the foot abscess and antitubercular
      drug therapy resulted in satisfactory control of tubercular infection.
      Polyarticular presentation may not always signify active tubercular focus in
      every joint; it may reflect reactive synovitis known as Poncet's disease, which
      resolves with multidrug antitubercular therapy.A multidispilinary approach should
      be adopted and chest physicians, rheumatologists and orthopaedic surgeons should 
      work in close association to correctly diagnose and treatthis condition.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Ventriculitis is an uncommon condition with a poor prognosis,
      especially when complicated by brain abscess. We compared the therapeutic
      efficacy of neuroendoscopic ventricular irrigation with those of conventional
      treatments such as ventricular drainage and continuous irrigation via a
      ventricular drain. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 14
      consecutive patients treated for ventriculitis at our institution between 2001
      and 2015. Included were the six patients treated with neuroendoscopic (NE)
      irrigation (NE group), which we adopted in 2011, and the eight patients treated
      before 2011 with conventional treatments (non-NE group). We compared mortality,
      modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score 6 months postoperatively, and duration of
      ventricular/spinal drainage-catheter placement between groups. RESULTS: Mean age 
      at onset was 49.3 years (range, 32-68 years) in the NE group and 50.3 years
      (range, 8-78 years) in the non-NE group. At 6-month follow-up, good clinical
      outcome (mRS</=3) was observed in 66.7% of the NE group, whereas it was observed 
      in 25.0% of the non-NE group. There were three deaths (37.5%) in the non-NE group
      but none in the NE group. Duration of drainage-catheter placement was
      significantly shorter in the NE group than in the non-NE group (19.8days vs.
      70.9days, p<0.001). Among patients in the NE group, only those who underwent
      irrigation on the day of diagnosis maintained a low mRS score. CONCLUSION:
      Neuroendoscopic ventricular irrigation was safe and effective in the treatment of
      ventriculitis. Immediate intervention after diagnosis may lead to an improved
      prognosis.

AB  - Among image-guided thermo-ablative techniques, percutaneous radiofrequency
      ablation (PRFA) is the most widely used technique for the treatment of primary
      and secondary lung malignancies. Tolerance of PRFA in the lung is excellent.
      However, relatively little is known about potential rare complications. This
      article presents both the clinical and imaging features of lung PRFA
      complications as well as their prevention and management. Complications may be
      classified in four groups: pleuropulmonary (e.g., bronchopleural or bronchial
      fistula, delayed abscess or aspergilloma inside post-PRFA cavitations, pulmonary 
      artery pseudo aneurysm, gas embolism and interstitial pneumonia); thoracic wall
      and vertebral (e.g., rib or vertebral fractures and intercostal artery injury);
      mediastinal and apical (e.g., neural damage); or diaphragmatic. Most
      complications can be managed with conservative treatment, percutaneous or
      endoscopic drainage, or surgical repair.

TI  - Pyomyositis at the surgical site in a patient with chronic myeloid leukemia: a
      case report and literature review.
PG  - 116
LID - 10.1186/s12957-016-0873-x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Pyomyositis is a rare, subacute, deep pyogenic infection of the
      muscle tissue. This disease has been previously described in patients that were
      immunocompromised due to a hematological malignancy. CASE PRESENTATION: A
      68-year-old man with a history of chronic myeloid leukemia was treated with
      imatinib. He was diagnosed with ascending colon cancer and underwent curative
      surgery. His postoperative course was uneventful, and he was healthy at 6 months 
      after surgery, allowing for reinitiation of imatinib therapy. After the
      reinitiation of therapy, a computed tomography (CT) scan revealed a mass shadow
      in the right iliopsoas muscle. This lesion was clinically diagnosed as recurrent 
      colon cancer with an abscess, which was resected surgically. A pathological
      examination uncovered both edema and inflammation. Two months after the second
      surgery, imatinib therapy was reinitiated; however, he again developed painful
      swelling and erythema in his right thigh. A CT scan revealed a similar shadow as 
      described previously. He was then diagnosed with pyomyositis; he underwent
      incisional drainage and was administered linezolid. Following the treatment for
      pyomyositis, there was no cancer recurrence or evidence of any recurrent
      pyomyositis. CONCLUSIONS: Findings from this case suggest that both undergoing
      surgery and receiving imatinib therapy may modulate an individual's immune
      response, whereby the surgical site becomes more prone to infection and may
      predispose an individual to pyomyositis. The case report is followed by a
      discussion of the literature regarding this disease, including potential risk
      factors and the underlying pathogenesis.

AB  - Actinomyces spp are found in the flora of the oral cavity and vagina and may
      cause infection with abscess formation and draining sinuses. Cervicofacial
      manifestations of actinomycosis involve head and neck soft tissue, however,
      spread to the cervical spine is rare. We report a case of an 8-year-old boy,
      presenting with neck pain for 1 month and denying a history of trauma or
      procedures. Radiography revealed an ulceration of the posterior oropharyngeal
      mucosa with a defect extending to the C1-C2 vertebra, mimicking a neoplastic
      process. The patient underwent laryngoscopy and multiple biopsies were taken from
      the ulcer and bone, showing severe osteomyelitis and intraosseous filamentous
      organisms, morphologically consistent with Actinomyces spp. The boy received
      long-term antibiotics with response to treatment. Actinomycosis has rarely been
      reported in the cervical vertebrae of paediatric patients. This should be
      considered as a differential diagnosis for such a presentation as prompt
      antibiotic treatment may be lifesaving.

TI  - Metastatic muscle abscesses complicating infected total hip arthroplasty.
PG  - 54-7
AB  - A 73-year-old woman with rheumatoid arthritis presented to our institution with
      infection of her right total hip arthroplasty. On admission, a draining sinus
      tract over the hip and a palpable mass in the left lower posterior region of the 
      neck were detected. The contrast CT scan showed a large abscess in the trapezius 
      muscle and multiple abscesses involving muscle of the neck and right shoulder.
      Intraoperative specimens from the muscle abscess were positive for presumably the
      same methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus that sustained the prosthetic
      joint infection. Prolonged intravenous daptomycin led to remission of the muscle 
      abscess and control of the prosthetic joint infection. The patient refused
      revision total hip arthroplasty and oral cotrimoxazole was prescribed for chronic
      suppression of the infection. Three years after the primary surgery there was
      stable remission of the prosthetic joint infection. This rare case demonstrates
      the severity of prosthetic joint infections sustained by multiresistant bacteria 
      in immunocompromised hosts, which may result in their bacteraemic spread.

TI  - [Case-control studies of two kinds of method for the treatment of lumbar
      tuberculosis with psoas abscess].
PG  - 33-7
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare two kinds of method for treating lumbar tuberculosis with
      psoas abscess, to provide reference for clinical reasonable select of therapy
      treatment. METHODS: From January 2010 to January 2013,42 patients with lumbar
      tuberculosis combined with psoas abscess with obvious surgical indications were
      enrolled, including 24 males and 18 females with an average age of (38.5 +/-
      10.2) years old ranging from 21 to 63 years old. All patients were followed up
      for 18 to 24 months with an average of 20.9 months. Twenty-two patients underwent
      posterior vertebral body lesions cleared, bone graft fusion and internal fixation
      and percutaneous puncture catheter drainage for treatment of psoas major abscess 
      as group A, and twenty patients underwent one-stage extraperitoneal approach to
      remove abscess, posterior vertebral body lesions cleared, bone graft fusion and
      internal fixation as group B. The operative time, loss of blood, length of
      hospital stay, clinical cure rate and other clinical results for the two groups
      were analyzed and compared. RESULTS: The loss of blood was (452.3 +/- 137.6) ml
      in group A and (603.5 +/- 99.6) ml in group B, there was significant statistical 
      difference (P < 0.05). The time of operation was (193.6 +/- 91.2) min in group A 
      and (230.5 +/- 56.6) min in group B, there was significant statistical difference
      (P < 0.05). The time of operation and the loss of blood in group A were obviously
      less than which in group B. In group A 20 cases were cured and 2 cases relapsed, 
      19 cases were cured and 1 case relapsed in group B, there was no significant
      statistical differences between two groups regarding cure rate with chi-square
      test (chi(2) = 0.000, P = 1.000). All patients in two groups obtained good
      clinical curative effect. There were no significant statistical difference
      between two groups regarding for length of hospital stay with t-test (P > 0.05). 
      CONCLUSION: Lumbar spinal tuberculosis with psoas abscess is not absolute
      indications for anterior open operation. Compared with the combined anterior and 
      posterior surgical procedure, the percutaneous puncture catheter drainage
      combined with posterior debridement, interbody fusion and internal fixation can
      achieve the same clinical effect but less trauma for the patients.

      Artery. A Case Report].
PG  - 50-4
AB  - The case of a 67-year-old woman with a combination of pelvic pyomyositis and
      left-sided sacroiliitis is reported. After a failed two-week antibiotic therapy, 
      CT-guided percutaneous drainage of psoas muscle abscesses was performed and
      methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was isolated. Subsequently, a 
      regression of symptoms was observed. At 6.5 weeks after the onset of symptoms,
      progression of sacroiliac joint (SI) destruction was again observed and an open
      revision of the SI joint was indicated (posterior approach, drainage and lavage).
      This again was followed by symptom regression. At 9.5 weeks after the patient was
      admitted, her condition markedly deteriorated and a large gluteal abscess was
      detected on CT examination. The second revision surgery was complicated by
      massive bleeding and, due to a septic pseudoaneurysm, internal iliac artery
      ligation was necessary. A significant subsidence of inflammatory changes and no
      pseudoaneurysm were shown on the follow-up CT scan. The intravenous antibiotic
      therapy with clindamycin was continued. At follow-up, repeated microbiological
      cultures from both tissue samples and drained secretions were all negative and CT
      scanning detected neither any fluid around the SI joint nor a pseudoaneurysm.

TI  - The efficacy of local continuous chemotherapy and postural drainage in
      combination with one-stage posterior surgery for the treatment of lumbar spinal
      tuberculosis.
PG  - 66
LID - 10.1186/s12891-016-0921-2 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The objective of this study was to compare the outcomes of one-stage 
      posterior surgery involving debridement, bone grafting, and instrumentation with 
      and without local continuous chemotherapy and postural drainage for the treatment
      of lumbar spinal tuberculosis. METHODS: From January 2009 to January 2013, 109
      patients with lumbar spinal tuberculosis were treated in our center using a
      posterior surgical approach. Patients underwent one-stage posterior debridement, 
      bone grafting, and instrumentation, without (group A) and with (group B) local
      continuous chemotherapy and postural drainage. Clinical and radiographic results 
      for the two groups were analyzed and compared. Clinical efficacy was evaluated
      based on surgery duration and blood loss. The Frankel scale was used to evaluate 
      neurological function. A visual analog scale was used to assess low back pain.
      Bone graft fusion and instrumentation failure were monitored by radiography, and 
      tuberculosis activity was monitored by erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and
      C-reactive protein testing. RESULTS: Groups A and B contained 52 and 57 patients,
      respectively. Patients were followed for 18-36 (mean, 26.64 +/- 4.2) months. All 
      bone grafts ultimately fused, but the fusion rate was significantly more rapid in
      group B [6.4 +/- 0.5 (range, 5-10) months] than in group A [8.9 +/- 0.6 (range,
      6-12) months; P < 0.05]. At 6 weeks postoperatively, ESR levels differed
      significantly between groups A and B (24.6 +/- 1.5 vs. 16.3 +/- 1.1 mm/h; P <
      0.05). ESR levels normalized in both groups at 16 weeks. CONCLUSIONS: Local
      continuous chemotherapy and postural drainage effectively eliminated infection
      foci caused by abscess remnants and accelerated interbody bone fusion in patients
      with lumbar spinal tuberculosis undergoing one-stage posterior surgery involving 
      debridement, bone grafting, and instrumentation.

TI  - Bilateral primary psoas abscesses due to methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus
      aureus in a neutropenic patient: a case report.
PG  - 12
LID - 10.1186/s13256-015-0781-7 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Pyogenic abscess of psoas muscles is a rare condition. Psoas abscess 
      due to methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus is an emerging and rare
      infection and so far the related data are scarce. CASE PRESENTATION: We report
      the rare case of primary and bilateral large psoas abscesses due to
      methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus in a 54-year-old Arab Jordanian woman
      with breast cancer who had neutropenia after starting chemotherapy. She was
      diagnosed 50 days after onset of symptoms. However, despite this delay in
      diagnosis and the large size of the abscesses, she had a full recovery. She was
      treated with antibiotics and percutaneous drainage and was doing very well at a
      follow up of 18 months. CONCLUSIONS: Psoas abscess due to methicillin-resistant
      Staphylococcus aureus might have insidious presentation with extensive disease
      especially in immunocompromised patients. However, it can be managed effectively 
      with percutaneous catheter drainage and appropriate antibiotic therapy.

TI  - Bacterial Infection in Deep Paraspinal Muscles in a Parturient Following Epidural
      Analgesia: A Case Report and Literature Review: A CARE-Compliant Article.
PG  - e2149
LID - 10.1097/MD.0000000000002149 [doi]
AB  - Bacterial infection related to epidural catheterizations could occur. In general,
      the incidence of postoperative infection at the insertion site is very low.
      Paucity literatures are reported for paraspinal muscle infection after epidural
      analgesia in parturient. We report a case of paraspinal muscle infection shortly 
      after epidural analgesia in a parturient, who was subjected to because of
      threatened preterm labor. Epidural morphine was administered for 2 days for
      childbirth pain control. She began to have constant low-back pain and fever on
      postpartum Day 2. Magnetic resonance image revealed a broad area of subcutaneous 
      edema with a continuum along the catheter trajectory deep to the paraspinal
      muscles. A catheter-related bacterial infection was suspected. The surgical
      debridement and drainage was required combined with intravenous antibiotics on
      postpartum Day 3. She was soon cured uncomplicatedly. Epidural analgesia is
      effective to control labor pain and, in general, it is safe. However, the
      sequelae of complicated infection may be underestimated. A literature search
      yielded 7 other cases of catheter-related epidural abscess or soft tissue
      infection. Vigilance for these infections, especially in postpartum patients with
      backache, is needed. Moreover, early detection and proper treatment of infectious
      signs at postanesthetic visit are very important.

TI  - Multiple recurrent postoperative spinal infections due to an unrecognized
      presacral abscess following placement of bicortical sacral screws: case report.
PG  - 502-5
LID - 10.3171/2015.4.SPINE141059 [doi]
AB  - Postoperative wound infections in spinal surgery remain an important complication
      to diagnose and treat successfully. In most cases of deep infection, even with
      instrumentation, aggressive soft-tissue debridement followed by intravenous
      antibiotics is sufficient. This report presents a patient who underwent L3-S1
      laminectomy and pedicle screw placement including bicortical sacral screws. This 
      patient went on to develop multiple (7) recurrent infections at the operative
      site over a 5-year period. Continued investigation eventually revealed a large
      presacral abscess, which remained the source of recurrent bacterial seeding via
      the remaining bone tracts of the bicortical sacral screws placed during the
      original lumbar surgery. Two years after drainage of this presacral collection
      via a retroperitoneal approach, the patient remains symptom free.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: We describe a patient who had cervical spine osteomyelitis caused
      by Blastomyces dermatitidis that resulted in cord compression and cervical spine 
      instability. CASE PRESENTATION: A 25-year-old Hispanic woman presented with
      fever, sweats, neck pain, and an enlarging neck mass with purulent discharge
      after sustaining a C6 vertebral body fracture. Magnetic resonance imaging
      confirmed C6 vertebral osteomyelitis, demonstrated by vertebral body destruction,
      cervical spine instability, prevertebral abscess, and spinal cord compression.
      She underwent C6 anterior cervical corpectomy and fusion, with fungal cultures
      confirming Blastomyces dermatitidis. CONCLUSIONS: Anterior cervical corpectomy
      and fusion successful debrided, decompressed, and restored cervical spine
      stability in a patient with vertebral osteomyelitis caused by Blastomyces
      dermatitidis. The patient was subsequently treated with a 1-year course of
      itraconazole and had no recurrence of infection 4 years postoperatively.

PG  - 237-41

AB  - Klebsiella pneumoniae liver abscess has a tendency to spread to distant sites
      early in the course of disease and to involve multiple organs synchronously. A
      59-year-old male was admitted because of liver abscess accompanied by fever and
      abdominal pain. The patient underwent percutaneous catheter drainage and received
      intravenous antibiotics. Symptom relief was achieved after the treatment as well 
      as marked reduction in the size of the abscess. Despite proper treatment of the
      liver abscess, however, patient developed multiple metastatic infections in a
      non-concurrent manner: left and right endophthalmitis, psoas abscess, and
      infectious spondylitis at 5, 23, 30 and 65 days after initial manifestations of
      liver abscess, respectively. Each infectious episode followed one another after
      resolution of the former one. For each episode of metastatic infections, the
      patient promptly underwent treatment with systemic and local antibiotics,
      interventional abscess drainage, and surgical treatments as needed. The patient
      fully recovered without sequelae after the use of intravenous antibiotics for an 
      extended period of time. Herein, we report a case of K. pneumoniae liver abscess 
      complicated with delayed-onset multiple metastatic infections.

AB  - BACKGROUND CONTEXT: No direct comparison between brucellar spondylodiscitis (BSD)
      and tuberculous spondylodiscitis (TSD) exists in the literature. PURPOSE: This
      study aimed to compare directly the clinical features, laboratory and
      radiological aspects, treatment, and outcome data of patients diagnosed as BSD
      and TSD. STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective, multinational, and multicenter study was 
      used. PATIENT SAMPLE: A total of 641 (TSD, 314 and BSD, 327) spondylodiscitis
      patients from 35 different centers in four countries (Turkey, Egypt, Albania, and
      Greece) were included. OUTCOME MEASURES: The pre- and peri- or post-treatment
      spinal deformity and neurologic deficit parameters, and mortality were carried
      out. METHODS: Brucellar spondylodiscitis and TSD groups were compared for
      demographics, clinical, laboratory, radiological, surgical interventions,
      treatment, and outcome data. The Student t test and Mann-Whitney U test were used
      for group comparisons. Significance was analyzed as two sided and inferred at
      0.05 levels. RESULTS: The median baseline laboratory parameters including white
      blood cell count, C-reactive protein, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate were
      higher in TSD than BSD (p<.0001). Prevertebral, paravertebral, epidural, and
      psoas abscess formations along with loss of vertebral corpus height and
      calcification were significantly more frequent in TSD compared with BSD (p<.01). 
      Surgical interventions and percutaneous sampling or abscess drainage were applied
      more frequently in TSD (p<.0001). Spinal complications including gibbus
      deformity, kyphosis, and scoliosis, and the number of spinal neurologic deficits,
      including loss of sensation, motor weakness, and paralysis were significantly
      higher in the TSD group (p<.05). Mortality rate was 2.22% (7 patients) in TSD,
      and it was 0.61% (2 patients) in the BSD group (p=.1). CONCLUSIONS: The results
      of this study show that TSD is a more suppurative disease with abscess formation 
      requiring surgical intervention and characterized with spinal complications. We
      propose that using a constellation of constitutional symptoms (fever, back pain, 
      and weight loss), pulmonary involvement, high inflammatory markers, and
      radiological findings will help to differentiate between TSD and BSD at an early 
      stage before microbiological results are available.

TI  - Lemierre Disease: A Case With Multilevel Epidural Abscess and Aggressive
      Neurological Weakness: Case Report and Literature Review.
PG  - e58-e61
AB  - BACKGROUND: Lemierre disease is a rare postanginal sepsis caused by the anaerobe 
      Fusobacterium necrophorum. It is associated with a pharyngitis that progresses
      quickly to thrombophlebitis of the internal jugular vein and metastatic abscesses
      to pulmonary, soft tissue, articular, and organ systems. It is rarely associated 
      with spinal epidural abscesses. Because of the increasing antibiotic resistance, 
      its incidence is on the rise. METHODS: A single-patient case report of an
      adolescent male who initially presented to our institution for bacteremia and
      febrile episodes. Over a 1-week course, he developed severe back pain and
      progressive lower extremity weakness. Advanced imaging revealed an epidural
      abscess spanning T2-L3 level with extension into the psoas and the paraspinal
      musculature. Acute management consisted of broad-spectrum intravenous (IV)
      antibiotics and hemilaminectomy decompression from T2 to L3. The patient
      completed a 6-week course of IV antibiotics and was followed for a 1-year time
      period with close clinical follow-up. RESULTS: Blood cultures identified the
      infecting organism as F. necrophorum. The combination of IV antibiotics and acute
      hemilaminectomy decompression resulted in successful clearance of the infecting
      organism with normalization of inflammatory markers and cultures. The patient
      noted immediate and sustained neurological improvement, with return of full motor
      and sensory function. At the 1-year timepoint, the patient was able to return to 
      sports and no sagittal/coronal imbalance was noted on radiographs. CONCLUSIONS:
      An aggressive case of Lemierre disease with extensive epidural abscess formation 
      and neurological weakness was successfully managed with the combination of IV
      antibiotics and extensive hemilaminectomies for decompression. The patient
      exhibited no long-term sequela as a result of either the epidural abscess or of
      its treatment. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level V.

TI  - Cervical spondylodiscitis with epidural abscess after knife stab wounds to the
      neck: A case report.

LID - 10.1016/j.injury.2015.05.043 [doi]
LID - S0020-1383(15)00302-2 [pii]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Cervical spondylodiscitis is usually caused by pyogenic infections,
      associated with retropharyngeal abscesses, or due to the swallowing of foreign
      bodies. No cases of cervical spondylodiscitis caused by a penetrating neck injury
      have been published in the literature. We describe a case of cervical
      spondylodiscitis after multiple knife stab wounds to the lateral soft tissue of
      the neck. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Case report and review of the literature.
      RESULTS: A 54-year-old patient was brought to our clinic with destructive
      spondylodiscitis C3/4 with paravertebral and epidural abscesses. He had been
      involved in a fight and had suffered multiple stab wounds to his neck with a
      knife 1 month prior. The initial CT scan had revealed one deeper wound canal
      behind the sternocleidomastoid muscle on the left side without any injury to the 
      vessels. The wound was cleaned and an antibiotic therapy with cefuroxime was
      given for 1 week. After an uneventful and complete healing of the wound the
      patient developed severe neck pain. Inflammatory laboratory parameters were
      elevated, and a MRI of the neck revealed a distinct spondylodiscitis C3/4 with
      paravertebral and epidural abscess formations. Surgery was performed and included
      debridement, abscess drainage, decompression of the spinal canal, fusion of the
      C3/4 segment using an autologous iliac crest bone graft and a plate
      osteosynthesis. A course of calculated antibiotic therapy was administered for 8 
      weeks. Normal laboratory parameters and no radiological signs of an ongoing
      inflammatory process were observed during follow-up examinations. The C3/4
      segment was consolidated. CONCLUSION: Stab wound injuries to the neck not only
      bear the risk of injuries to the nerves, vessels and organs of the neck but also 
      increase the risk of developing secondary spondylodiscitis. Specifically,
      cervical spondylodiscitis can result in distinct neurological symptoms, and
      surgical intervention should be performed in a timely manner.

TI  - Treatment of pediatric spinal tuberculosis abscess with percutaneous drainage and
      low-dose local antituberculous therapy: a preliminary report.
PG  - 1149-55
LID - 10.1007/s00381-015-2694-6 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the outcomes of computed
      tomography (CT) guidance using percutaneous catheter with low-dose drainage local
      chemotherapy (modified PCD) and antituberculous therapy (ATT) for the treatment
      of spinal tuberculosis in children. METHODS: Twenty-seven children suffering from
      spinal tuberculosis were treated with modified PCD and ATT in our institute from 
      2002 to 2012. We describe our treatment, which involves CT-guided percutaneous
      puncture and local chemotherapy (continuous low-dose (20 mL) irrigation). The
      patients were evaluated based on the Frankel scoring system, the kyphotic Cobb
      angle, and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR). RESULTS: All patients were
      followed up for an average of 31.00 +/- 13.94 months. No sinus formation was
      detected. All patients responded well to this treatment. The ESR values were
      decreased to normal at last follow-up. The neurological functions show
      significant improvement after operation. Preoperatively, the kyphotic angle was
      22.89 +/- 7.06 degrees , and it was measured as 21.19 +/- 8.73 degrees at the
      last visit. CONCLUSIONS: Our results showed that percutaneous intubation and
      low-dose irrigation under CT guidance (modified percutaneous catheter drainage
      (MPCD)) and ATT are easy, safe, efficient, and less invasive methods for the
      treatment of spinal tuberculosis in children.

TI  - An 81-year-old male with iliopsoas abscess by Streptococcus sanguis.
PG  - 56-60
AB  - Iliopsoas muscle abscess is an uncommon condition, which has been growing in
      incidence. We describe a primary iliopsoas abscess by Streptococcus sanguis
      affecting an 81-year-old man cured by antibiotic therapy and aspiration
      procedure. The objective is to enhance the suspicion index about the iliopsoas
      abscess that may be mistaken for other causes of acute abdomen. The important
      diagnostic role of abdominal imaging studies is also emphasised.

AB  - A 70-year-old man on hemodialysis for end-stage kidney disease due to polycystic 
      kidney disease presented with hip pain on extension and a high C-reactive protein
      level. Further examinations revealed an iliopsoas abscess and femoral head
      osteomyelitis caused by Enterococcus avium (E. avium) detected in blood and pus
      cultures. Complete resolution of the infection with ampicillin-resistant E. avium
      required six months of vancomycin therapy and two surgical drainage procedures.
      There have been no previous case reports in which both blood and abscess cultures
      confirmed E. avium infection. Careful attention should be paid to the detection
      of non-specific symptoms in patients on hemodialysis, with blood cultures being
      essential in such cases.

AB  - STUDY DESIGN: This is a retrospective case series. OBJECTIVE: Tropical
      pyomyositis of erector spinae muscle (ESPM) is a rare muscular infection which
      may extend into the intraspinal canal to become spinal epidural abscess
      (ESPM-SEA). If left untreated, it may cause catatrophic spinal cord dysfunction
      and lead to irreversible paralysis. A series of eight such cases is presented, in
      order to provide proper surgical options and clarify the prognostic factors of
      the disease. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Merely six sporadic case reports had
      been found in the literature. Surgical debridement and laminectomy to drain the
      intraspinal abscess combined with systemic antibiotics were the choice of
      treatment to treat the disease with good therapeutic effect. METHODS: Inpatient
      charts of the patients were reviewed. The therapeutic effect and functional
      neurological recovery are correlated with the demographic characteristics of the 
      patients, neurological deficits before drainage, and the different procedures of 
      drainage. RESULTS: Old age, long ESPM-SEA (>6.5 vertebral segments), spinal cord 
      dysfunction as well as complete paralysis before the interventional procedures
      are significantly correlated with poor functional neurological recovery
      (Sperman's coefficient correlation, all p<0.05). Pig-tail drainage of ESPM
      combined with adequate systemic antibiotics could cure if infection presents with
      lumbar radiculopathy only, but it failed to rescue the spinal cord dysfunction in
      two patients present with complete paralysis. Surgical drainage of ESPM with
      mini-laminotomy to drain ESPM-SEA combined with systemic antibiotics provided
      good functional recovery of patients, despite of prolonged pre-operative complete
      paralysis. CONCLUSION: Early drainage of the ESPM and related epidural abscess
      combined with systemic antibiotics can provide excellent therapeutic effect of
      ESPM-SEA. Open drainage with mini-laminotomy is superior to pig-tail drainage
      when spinal cord dysfunction occurred associated with ESPM-SEA.

TI  - Surgery for blastomycosis of the spine.
PG  - E266-71
AB  - Blastomycosis is a rare fungal infection that primarily produces acute lung
      infections but may disseminate to multiple sites, including the spine. Once
      vertebral involvement occurs, an untreated infection may result in vertebral body
      destruction and paraspinal and epidural abscess formation followed by neurologic 
      injury and loss of structural integrity of the spine. We report the case of a
      30-year-old man who had pulmonary blastomycosis (treated with oral itraconazole
      for 6 months) and presented with a 2-month history of mild thoracolumbar back
      pain and numbness and tingling in the lower extremities, but no neurologic
      deficits. Imaging revealed a destructive lesion of T11 with an extensive
      paravertebral and retropleural abscess tracking a spinal level above and below
      with extension into the spinal canal. The patient underwent incision and
      drainage, culture procurement and corpectomy of T11 with autogenous rib graft in 
      a titanium cage, and, 1 week later, posterior fusion and instrumentation.
      Cultures were positive for Blastomycosis dermatitidis. Oral itraconazole was
      continued. Blastomycosis that disseminates to the spine may cause serious
      neurologic and structural complications. In most cases, long-term use of
      antifungal medication eradicates the infection. Should medical treatment fail,
      however, surgery is a useful option.

TI  - Posterior only versus combined posterior and anterior approaches in surgical
      management of lumbosacral tuberculosis with paraspinal abscess in adults.
PG  - 607-16
LID - 10.1007/s00068-013-0367-2 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To compare single-stage posterior transforaminal lumbar interbody
      fusion, debridement, posterior instrumentation, and postural drainage
      (posterior-only surgery) with a combined posterior-anterior surgical approach for
      treatment of adults with lumbosacral spinal tuberculosis (STB) with paraspinal
      abscess and to determine the clinical feasibility and effectiveness of
      posterior-only surgical treatment. METHODS: Thirty-nine patients with lumbosacral
      STB and paraspinal abscess were treated with one of two surgical procedures in
      our center from September 2003 to December 2012. Nineteen patients were treated
      with posterior-only surgery (Group A) and 20 were treated with combined
      posterior-anterior surgery (Group B). Surgery duration, intraoperative blood
      loss, length of hospitalization, bony fusion rates, complication rates,
      neurological status, lumbosacral angle correction, and Kirkaldy-Willis functional
      outcomes of the two groups were compared. RESULTS: The average follow-up period
      was 39.1 +/- 12.0 months for Group A and 40.7 +/- 12.4 months for Group B. Under 
      the Frankel classification, all patients improved with treatment. STB was
      completely cured and grafted bones were fused within 5-11 months in all patients.
      There were no persistent or recurrent infections or obvious differences in
      radiological results between the groups. The lumbosacral angle was significantly 
      corrected after surgical management, but loss of correction was seen in both
      groups. The average operative duration, blood loss, length of hospital stay, and 
      postoperative complication rate of Group A were lower than those of Group B.
      CONCLUSIONS: Posterior-only surgery is feasible and effective, resulting in
      better clinical outcomes than combined posterior-anterior surgeries, especially
      in surgical time, blood loss, hospital stay, and complications.

TI  - [Psoas abscess as a differential diagnosis in emergency department].
PG  - 268-73
AB  - BACKGROUND: A psoas (or iliopsoas) abscess is a rare clinical entity with a wide 
      etiological range. It is defined as a collection of pus that begins and extends
      through the iliopsoas muscle and can reach up to the inguinal region. METHODS: We
      performed a retrospective descriptive study by reviewing medical records from the
      General Surgery department of Reina Sofia's General University Hospital.
      Information was collected from patients diagnosed with psoas abscess who were
      admitted to the General Surgery department from 2006 to 2011. RESULTS: Five cases
      were reported for 6 years: four males (80%) and one female (20%). Average age was
      51.6 years (range: 35--75). All were admitted to the hospital through the
      Emergency Department. Lumbar pain, fever and rash were clinical features in three
      patients. Two patients initiated with septic shock. Each patient had computed
      tomography performed, which confirmed the diagnosis. Causes of the abscess were
      as follows: one perforated colon neoplasm, two left hip osteomyelitis, one
      Crohn's disease and one primary abscess. Surgery was the treatment in three cases
      and placement of pigtail drainage was the treatment in two patients. Two patients
      were admitted to the Intensive Care Unit and ultimately died. CONCLUSION: In our 
      case series report, it is seen that treatment delay developed to septic shock and
      death. We should consider this entity in emergency practice in order to carry out
      timely treatment.

PG  - 743-6
AB  - Iliopsoas abscess is a very rare pathology in the neonatal period. There is a
      lack of reports in the literature on bilateral psoas abscess with hip joint
      arthritis. We report a case of bilateral iliopsoas abscess with concomitant right
      hip septic arthritis, caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus in a 
      28-day-old male infant. The baby presented with bilateral diffuse swelling of the
      groins and upper thighs. He was treated successfully by ultrasound-guided
      percutaneous drainage along with systemic antibiotic therapy. Clinical
      improvement was observed within 24-48 hours of drainage.

TI  - Postoperative Mycoplasma hominis infections after neurosurgical intervention.
PG  - 212-8
LID - 10.3171/2014.4.PEDS13547 [doi]
AB  - OBJECT: Mycoplasma hominis is a rare cause of infection after neurosurgical
      procedures. The Mycoplasma genus contains the smallest bacteria discovered to
      date. Mycoplasma are atypical bacteria that lack a cell wall, a feature that
      complicates both diagnosis and treatment. The Gram stain and some types of
      culture media fail to identify these organisms, and typical broad-spectrum
      antibiotic regimens are ineffective because they act on cell wall metabolism.
      Mycoplasma hominis commonly colonizes the genitourinary tract in a nonvirulent
      manner, but it has caused postoperative, postpartum, and posttraumatic infections
      in various organ systems. The authors present the case of a 17-year-old male with
      a postoperative intramedullary spinal cord abscess due to M. hominis and report
      the results of a literature review of M. hominis infections after neurosurgical
      procedures. Attention is given to time to diagnosis, risk factors for infection, 
      ineffective antibiotic regimens, and final effective antibiotic regimens to
      provide pertinent information for the practicing neurosurgeon to diagnose and
      treat this rare occurrence. METHODS: A PubMed search was performed to identify
      reports of M. hominis infections after neurosurgical procedures. RESULTS: Eleven 
      cases of postneurosurgical M. hominis infection were found. No other cases of
      intramedullary spinal cord abscess were found. Initial antibiotic coverage was
      inadequate in all cases, and diagnosis was delayed in all cases. Multiple
      surgical interventions were often needed. Once appropriate antibiotics were
      started, patients typically experienced rapid resolution of their neurological
      symptoms. In 27% of cases, a suspicious genitourinary source other than urinary
      catheterization was identified. CONCLUSIONS: Postoperative M. hominis infections 
      are rarely seen after neurosurgical procedures. They are typically responsive to 
      appropriate antibiotic therapy. Mycoplasma infection may cause prolonged
      hospitalization and multiple returns to the operating room due to delay in
      diagnosis. Early clinical suspicion with appropriate antibiotic coverage could
      help prevent these significant complications.

TI  - [Brucellar spondylodiscitis: case series of the last 25 years].
PG  - 204-10
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Brucellosis is an endemic zoonosis in Portugal. Brucellar
      spondylodiscitis is one of the most frequent focal manifestations which may cause
      severe sequelae despite appropriate therapy. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Retrospective 
      study of patients with diagnosis of brucellar spondylodiscitis admitted to the
      Infectious Diseases Department of Centro Hospitalar e Universitario de Coimbra,
      over a 25-year period (1988-2012). RESULTS: We identified 54 patients, 55.6%
      male, mean age of 54.8 years. In 81.5% an epidemiological context was identified,
      mostly contact with sheep and goats. The duration of symptoms prior to diagnosis 
      was 5.5 months. The most common signs and symptoms were pain (98.1%), fever
      (46.3%) and neurological deficits (25.9%). Spinal magnetic resonance imaging was 
      the most used imaging method (77.8%) showing abscesses in 29.6% of patients.
      Lumbar location predominated (77.7%). Diagnosis was attained in 47 patients
      (87.0%): positive blood cultures (3 patients), positive serology (32 patients) or
      by both methods (12 patients). Combined regimens of doxycycline and rifampicin
      (64.8%), or streptomycin (24.1%) were most used, for an average duration of 4.4
      months. A patient was referred for surgery for abscess drainage. Evolution was
      mostly favorable (92.6%), no deaths occurring. DISCUSSION: Research of the
      epidemiologic context turned out to be a major key leading to the diagnosis.
      Treatment of osteoarticular brucellosis is still controversial. CONCLUSIONS:
      Brucellar spondylodiscitis should be considered in the differential diagnosis of 
      patients with low back pain, even in the absence of fever, particularly in
      regions where the disease is endemic. Antibiotic regimen, its' duration and the
      need for surgery should be individualized to achieve a better prognosis. Cases
      have declined over the years, a fact related to better control of animal endemic.

AB  - Staphylococcal pyomyositis is a severe invasive soft tissue infection with high
      mortality rate that is increasingly being recognized even in temperate climates. 
      In most cases predisposing factors are identified that include either source of
      skin penetration or/and impaired host immunocompetence. A case of primary,
      community-acquired pyomyositis of the left iliopsoas muscle in a 59-year-old
      immunocompetent woman, which was complicated with septic pulmonary emboli within 
      24h after hospital admission, is presented. The patient was subjected to abscess 
      drainage under computed tomography guidance. Both pus aspiration and blood
      cultures revealed methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus. Given the
      absolute absence of predisposing factors and a remote history of staphylococcal
      osteomyelitis in the same anatomical region 53 years ago, reactivation of a
      staphylococcal soft tissue infection was postulated. Systematic review of the
      literature revealed a few interesting cases of reactivated staphylococcal
      infection after decades of latency, although the exact pathophysiological
      mechanisms still need to be elucidated.

      treatment for primary bacterial vertebral osteomyelitis?
PG  - 226
LID - 10.1186/1471-2334-14-226 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Vertebral osteomyelitis (VO) may lead to disabling neurologic
      complications. Little evidence exists on optimal antibiotic management. METHODS: 
      All patients with primary, non-implant VO, admitted from 2000-2010 were
      retrospectively analyzed. Patients with endocarditis, immunodeficiency, vertebral
      implants and surgical site infection following spine surgery were excluded.
      Persistence of clinical or laboratory signs of inflammation at 1 year were
      defined as treatment failure. Logistic regression was used to estimate the odds
      ratios (OR) of switch to an oral regimen after 2 weeks. RESULTS: Median
      antibiotic treatment was 8.1 weeks in 61 identified patients. Switch to oral
      antibiotics was performed in 72% of patients after a median intravenous therapy
      of 2.7 weeks. Switch to oral therapy was already performed after two weeks in 34%
      of the patients. A lower CRP at 2 weeks was the only independent predictor for
      switch to oral therapy (OR 0.7, 95% confidence interval 0.5-0.9, p = 0.041, per
      10 mg/l increase). Staphylococcus aureus was the most frequently isolated
      microorganism (21%). Indications for surgery, other than biopsy, included
      debridement with drainage of epidural or paravertebral abscess (26 patients;
      42%), and CT-guided drainage (3 patients).During the follow-up, no recurrences
      were observed but 2 patients died of other reasons than VO, i.e. the 1 year
      intention to treat success rate was 97%. CONCLUSIONS: Cure rates for non-implant 
      VO were very high with partly short intravenous and overall antibiotic therapy.
      Switching to an oral antibiotic regimen after two weeks intravenous treatment may
      be safe, provided that CRP has decreased and epidural or paravertebral abscesses 
      of significant size have been drained.

TI  - Iliopsoas abscess in an infant.
PG  - 213-6
AB  - Iliopsoas abscess (IPA) is uncommon in childhood and very rare in the neonate and
      infant. We present a case of IPA after an umbilical granuloma in an infant. A
      baby girl with a birth weight of 2,970 g was born at thirty-seven weeks and two
      days gestation by Caesarean Section. On the fourteenth day after birth, her
      umbilicus was wet and developed the granulomatous formation. At two months of
      age, she presented with right leg and groin swelling with mild bluish
      discoloration and without fever. She had poor movement of her right leg and
      showed apparent discomfort. Her umbilicus was dry and there was no granulomatous 
      material. Ultrasonography and computed tomography demonstrated an iliopsoas
      abscess in the right position. Therefore, an extraperitoneal surgical drainage
      was performed, aspirating yellowish pus. Culture of the purulent material
      revealed Staphylococcus aureus. Systemic antibiotic therapy was continued for ten
      days. After three days of drainage, full-range motion of the right leg was
      gained, and then after eleven days, CT findings comfirmed the disappearance of
      the iliopsoas abscess. IPA is extremely rare and it is difficult to diagnose.
      However, it should be included in the differential diagnosis of an infant with
      poor leg movement and swelling of the groin to the femur.

TI  - Disseminated Rhodococcus equi infection in a patient with Hodgkin lymphoma.
PG  - 317-24
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Rhodococcus (R) equi is an opportunistic, uncommon human pathogen
      that causes mainly infection in immunocompromised hosts. The disease is usually
      presented as subacute pneumonia that is mostly cavitary and sometimes bacteremic.
      CASE REPORT: We reported the extremly rare case of a 43-year-old woman with
      Hodgkin lymphoma, who developed R equi pulmonary infection after recieving
      multiple courses of chemotherapy. Secondary, the patient developed bacteremia,
      leading to sepsis and dissemination of R equi infection in many extrapulmonary
      sites. At addmission the patient was febrile, tachypnoic, tachycardic,
      hypotensive, with fa cial edema, splenomegaly, positive meningeal signs, left
      hemiparesis and paraparesis. Laboratory data included erythrocyte sedimentation
      rate (ESR) > 140 mm/h, C-reactive protein (CRP) 143.0 mg/L, red blood cells (RBC)
      2.14 x 10(12)/L, whyite blood cells (WBC) 2.8 x 10(9)/L, lactate dehydrogenase
      (LDH) 706 U/L, serum albumin 26 g/L, sodium 127 mmol/L and potassium 2.7 mmol/L. 
      Blood culture and culture of sputum and empyema were positive for R equi. Imaging
      studies demonstrated a large right cavitary pneumonia and abscess, empyema,
      pericarditis, mediastinal and intra-abdominal lymphadenopathy, brain and psoas
      abscesses, osteomyelitis and spondylodiscitis. The patient recovered completely
      after a 12-month treatment with combinations of parenteral and oral antibiotics
      (meropenem, vancomycin, teicoplanin, ciprofloxacin, rifampicin, macrolides etc), 
      including drainage of abscesses and empyema. Eight years after completition of
      the treatment the patient was without recurrence of R equi infection and
      lymphoma. CONCLUSION: Since the eradication od R equi is very difficult, it is
      very important to make the diagnosis and initiate appropriate antibiotic therapy 
      as soon as possible.

AB  - One-third of the world's population is infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis. 
      Data reported in 2011 indicate, for the first time, a decline in cases of
      tuberculosis, despite persistent inequalities across geographic areas and
      increasing rates of drug resistance. Osteo-articular tuberculosis affects the
      spine in half the cases. Pharmacotherapy must be combined with surgery in
      patients with spinal cord or nerve root compression, large abscesses, or marked
      anterior column osteolysis with kyphosis and instability. The quality of
      debridement and bony fusion is optimal when the anterior approach is used.
      Posterior fixation is the best means of achieving reduction followed by stable
      sagittal alignment over time. New treatment strategies combine conventional
      surgical methods, closed interventional radiology procedures for drainage and
      spinal cord decompression, and percutaneous fixation.

TI  - Extended indications of percutaneous endoscopic lavage and drainage for the
      treatment of lumbar infectious spondylitis.
PG  - 846-53
LID - 10.1007/s00586-013-3157-y [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The treatment of spinal infection remains a challenge for spinal
      surgeons because of the variable presentations and complicated course. The
      diagnostic and therapeutic value of percutaneous endoscopic lavage and drainage
      (PELD) has been proved in some recent studies. The purpose of this study is to
      evaluate the efficacy of PELD in patients with advanced infectious spondylitis
      which may traditionally require open surgery. METHODS: We retrospectively
      reviewed the medical records of 21 patients who underwent PELD to treat their
      advanced lumbar infectious spondylitis. Patients with severe infection resulting 
      in significant neurological deficit and mechanical instability were excluded from
      the PELD procedure, which was only used on selected patients with less severe
      disease. The 21 patients were categorized into three groups based on their past
      history, clinical presentation, and imaging studies: those with paraspinal
      abscesses, postoperative recurrent infection, and multilevel infection. Clinical 
      outcomes were assessed by careful physical examination, Odom's criteria, regular 
      serologic testing, and imaging studies to determine whether continued
      conservative treatment or surgical intervention was necessary. RESULTS: Causative
      bacteria were identified in 19 (90.5%) of 21 biopsy specimens. Appropriate
      parenteral antibiotics for the predominant pathogen isolated from the infected
      tissue biopsy cultures were prescribed for the patients. All patients reported
      satisfactory recovery and relief of back pain, except three with multilevel
      infections who underwent anterior debridement and fusion within 2 weeks after
      treatment with PELD. The overall infection control rate was 86%. One patient with
      epidural abscess and spondylolytic spondylolisthesis of the L5-S1 received
      instrumented fusion surgery due to mechanical instability 5 months later. No
      surgery-related major complications were found, except 2 patients who had
      transient paraesthesia in the affected lumbar segment. CONCLUSIONS: PELD was
      successful in obtaining a bacteriologic diagnosis, relieving the patient's
      symptoms, and assisting in eradication of lumbar infectious spondylitis. The
      indications of this minimally invasive procedure could be extended to treat
      patients suffering from spinal infections with paraspinal abscesses and
      postoperative recurrent infection. Patients with multilevel infection may have
      trivial benefits from PELD due to poor infection control and mechanical
      instability of the affected segments.

TI  - Management of brain abscesses. I: Drainage and antiseptics.
PG  - 1669-74
AB  - Listerian antisepsis opened the way to surgical treatment of brain abscesses, at 
      a time when advances in neurology made it possible to localize many of these
      lethal infections. William Macewen, a pupil of Joseph Lister, published in 1893 a
      remarkable monograph on pyogenic diseases of the brain and spinal cord. He
      recognized that these were caused by bacterial infection, and reported a series
      of 20 cerebral and cerebellar abscesses, treated by surgical drainage with
      antiseptic precautions. His mortality was amazingly low, but later surgeons were 
      less successful. The causes of failure included inability to control microbial
      infection of the brain. Various chemical antiseptics and also serotherapy were
      tried, but mortality remained very high.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Psoas abscess complicating tuberculous spondylitis is a rare
      morbidity in extrapulmonary tuberculosis. There are no established guidelines for
      evaluating the clinical response of psoas abscess. Although several studies have 
      shown that positron emission tomography-computed tomography with 18
      F-fluorodeoxyglucose can play a potential role in diagnosing multifocal
      tuberculosis and monitoring the clinical response of pulmonary tuberculosis, to
      our knowledge, this is the first report demonstrating that positron emission
      tomography-computed tomography is useful for evaluating local inflammation and
      disease activity of a tuberculous psoas abscess. CASE PRESENTATION: We report a
      case of multifocal bone and lymph node tuberculosis with concomitant lumbar psoas
      abscess in a 77-year-old man, along with a literature review. An initial positron
      emission tomography-computed tomography scan showed intense 18
      F-fluorodeoxyglucose accumulation in the sternum, ribs, vertebrae, and lymph
      nodes. The patient was successfully treated with antitubercular agents and
      computed tomography-guided drainage therapy. A follow-up positron emission
      tomography-computed tomography after abscess drainage and 9 months of
      antitubercular drug treatment revealed that the majority of lesions improved;
      however, protracted inflammation surrounding the psoas abscess was still
      observed. These results indicate that disease activity of psoas abscess can
      remain, even after successful drainage and antitubercular medication regime of
      appropriate duration. CONCLUSION: We have successfully followed up the extent of 
      skeletal tuberculosis complicated with psoas abscess by positron emission
      tomography-computed tomography. In this patient, positron emission
      tomography-computed tomography is useful for evaluating the disease activity of
      tuberculous psoas abscess and for assessing the appropriate duration of
      antitubercular drug therapy in psoas abscess.

TI  - [A case of culture-negative brain abscess caused by Streptococcus intermedius
      infection diagnosed by broad-range PCR of 16S ribosomal RNA].
PG  - 1199-203
AB  - A 50-year-old man presented with altered mental status during hospitalization for
      pneumonia. MRI showed multifocal ring-enhanced lesions, which consisted of
      multiple cerebral abscesses. We started empirical antibiotic therapy, but the
      following morning, his condition rapidly deteriorated and a CT scan revealed
      acute hydrocephalus, which required ventricular drainage. Gram staining of
      cerebro-spinal fluid from the ventricular drainage showed gram-positive cocci in 
      chains, but culture results were negative. 16S ribosomal RNA sequencing with
      broad-range PCR of the cerebro-spinal fluid identified Streptococcus intermedius.
      On the basis of this identification, the antibiotic regimen was changed to
      ampicillin monotherapy. After 1 year of antibiotic therapy, all the abscesses had
      disappeared and the patient was discharged without any sequelae. Bacterial 16S
      rRNA gene analysis with broad-range PCR is a very useful method for facilitating 
      the etiological diagnosis and selection of appropriate treatment for
      culture-negative infections.

AB  - Pneumorachis rarely occurs after spreading from a contiguous site of infection or
      after a traumatic event. We describe an adult patient who developed sepsis and a 
      renal abscess due to Citrobacter koseri, and computed tomographic imaging
      identified gas within the entire spinal canal as well as an iliopsoas abscess.
      This patient recovered from pneumorachis caused by disseminated infection.

PG  - 98-103

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Iliopsoas abscess (IPA) is a collection of pus in the iliopsoas
      compartment, which is considered rare in Japan. However, the number of patients
      with IPA has recently increased among the elderly or compromised hosts. SUBJECTS 
      AND METHODS: This retrospective study aims to examine the clinical pictures,
      pathological findings, and the prognostic factor of IPA. We analyzed all patients
      with IPA who were admitted to our hospital from April 2006 to July 2011.
      Patients' characteristics, treatment, clinical outcome, radiological findings,
      bacteria isolated, and comorbidities were evaluated. The comorbidities were
      evaluated by the Charlson comorbidity index (CCI). We compared the survival and
      non-survival groups to assess the prognostic factors of IPA. RESULTS: A total of 
      33 patients were enrolled in this study, which included 14 males and 19 females. 
      The mean age of the patients was 71.5 years (range 32-92 years). The most common 
      underlying disease was spinal disease (16 of 33, 48.5%). Twenty-nine patients
      (87.9%) were cured and four patients (12.1%) died. While 12 patients (36.4%) were
      initially treated conservatively with antibiotics alone, percutaneous drainage
      was performed initially in 19 patients (57.6%). Two patients (6%) directly
      underwent exploratory surgery and open drainage. In terms of patients'
      characteristics, there were no significant differences in either group. The score
      of CCI in non-survivors was higher than that in survivors (1.38 vs. 5.5, P <
      0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The epidemiology of IPA is quite different from what it used
      to be. CCI appears to be useful in evaluating the patients' prognosis with IPA.

TI  - Pott's paraplegia secondary to Scrofuloderma is a rare association.
PG  - 931-3
LID - 10.1038/sc.2013.101 [doi]
AB  - STUDY DESIGN: Spinal tuberculosis as all other osteoarticular tuberculosis occurs
      as a result of hematogenous dissemination of Mycobacterium tuberculosis from a
      primarily infected visceral focus mainly lungs, but Pott's paraplegia occurring
      secondarily to Scrofuloderma has not been reported till date. PURPOSE: To
      document such an association of Pott's paraplegia and Scrofuloderma. METHODS: A
      29-year-old female presented to us with low backache and paraplegia of 1 month
      duration. Clinical examination showed multiple healed Scrofuloderma lesions over 
      sterum and neck (Figure 1). Magnetic resonance imaging (Figure 4), computed
      tomography (Figure 3) and X-ray (Figure 2) showed Pott's spine involving dorsal
      vertebrae (D8-10) with pre and paravetebral abscess with intraspinal extension.
      She was treated by minimally invasive surgery to drain pus and granulation tissue
      by resecting transverse process of D9 vertebra. Drained material was sent for
      histopathological examination, Zielh-neelsen (ZN) staining, culture and
      sensitivity for M. tuberculosis. Patient completely recovered neurologically
      after 1 month of surgery. RESULTS: Patient completely recovered neurologically
      after surgery and is presently on multidrug chemotherapy and spinal brace.
      CONCLUSIONS: Pott's paraplegia can occur secondary to Scrofuloderma and it can be
      managed by multidrug antitubercular therapy and minimally invasive surgical
      procedure.

TI  - Abdominal aortic aneurysmal and endovascular device infection with iliopsoas
      abscess caused by Mycobacterium bovis as a complication of intravesical bacillus

AB  - Vascular complications after the intravesical instillation of Bacillus
      Calmette-Guerin (BCG) therapy are extremely rare. We experienced a case of
      abdominal aortic aneurysmal infection excluded by a stent graft with an iliopsoas
      abscess after intravesical instillation of BCG therapy that required reoperation.
      Five years ago, an 81-year-old man was diagnosed with transitional cell carcinoma
      of the bladder. After transurethral resection of the bladder tumor and
      intravesical BCG therapy, a radical cystectomy was performed. Twenty-four months 
      after intravesical BCG therapy, follow-up an abdominal computed tomographic (CT) 
      scan revealed an aortic abdominal aneurysm. Endovascular aneurysm repair was
      performed, and the aneurysm was excluded postoperatively. Thirty months after the
      endovascular aneurysm repair (and 54 months after intravesical BCG therapy), a
      follow-up abdominal CT revealed a low-density area in the right iliopsoas muscle 
      that formed a fistula to the excluded aneurysm. We performed CT-guided iliopsoas 
      abscess drainage and collected yellow pus. Polymerase chain reaction analysis
      revealed that the pus was positive for Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex. The
      patient was diagnosed with abdominal aortic aneurysmal infection associated with 
      iliopsoas abscess caused by Mycobacterium bovis, and surgery was performed. We
      performed an extra-anatomical bypass and removed the stent graft with
      debridement. When the aneurysmal wall was incised and resected, yellow pus
      surrounded the stent graft. In addition, a large fistula was present between the 
      right posterolateral aortic aneurysmal wall and the iliopsoas abscess cavity.
      After the operation, the histopathological examination of excised abdominal
      aortic aneurysmal wall tissue revealed an epithelioid granuloma with caseous
      necrosis involving multinucleated giant cells, indicating M tuberculosis complex 
      infection. Although the intravesical instillation of BCG therapy is considered
      safe, complications resulting from vascular infections can arise in extremely
      rare cases. The complication described in this case report emphasizes the need to
      cautiously select treatment for a mycotic aortic aneurysm after intravesical
      instillation of BCG therapy.

TI  - Management of postoperative intraabdominal abscess in laparoscopic versus open
      appendectomy.
PG  - 1-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: Complicated appendicitis (gangrenous or perforated appendicitis) is a
      risk for postoperative intraabdominal abscess, but management of intraabdominal
      abscess may differ between laparoscopic and open appendectomy. METHODS: We
      reviewed 67 patients who underwent appendectomy for complicated appendicitis,
      including 26 who received laparoscopic appendectomy (LA group) and 41 who
      underwent open appendectomy (OA group). The operation was performed under general
      anesthesia in all 26 patients in the LA group and in 10 (24%) in the OA group.
      Patient characteristics, operative factors, and postoperative complications
      (especially postoperative intraabdominal abscess) were compared between the two
      groups. Management of postoperative intraabdominal abscess was also investigated.
      RESULTS: Postoperative intraabdominal abscess occurred in 3 patients (12%) in the
      LA group and in 10 (24%) in the OA group (p = 0.23). All 3 patients in the LA
      group were treated conservatively. Of the 10 patients in the OA group, 6 were
      treated conservatively, but 4 needed a reoperation, including 3 who had undergone
      right pararectal skin incision under spinal analgesia and in whom sufficient
      irrigation was not possible because anesthesia had worn off. CONCLUSIONS: Our
      results suggest that insertion of abdominal drainage may be appropriate treatment
      for intraabdominal abscess after laparoscopic appendectomy. Light anesthesia may 
      induce residual abscess in open appendectomy performed under spinal analgesia.

TI  - Pott's disease: medical and surgical treatment.
PG  - 97-100
LID - 10.7417/CT.2013.1525 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the best treatment of Pott's disease. MATERIALS AND
      METHODS: 7 cases of Pott's disease were treated in the department of Neurosurgery
      of Sapienza University of Rome (Italy) between 2004 to 2011. RESULTS: All
      patients underwent surgical drainage of abscess and vertebral stabilization. In
      all cases culture exam showed positivity after 40 days of incubation. After
      surgery for a period of one year chemotherapy was administered. In all cases MRI 
      scan with gd of the spinal column were performed 12 months after surgery and no
      recurrence of disease has been shown. DISCUSSION: Pott's disease is defined as
      vertebral involvement of extrapulmonary Tubercolosis (TB), involving mainly
      toraco-lumbar tract of the spine. MRI with gd represents the gold standard for
      the diagnosis. Treatment can be medical, surgical or usually both. The slippery
      course of the disease often causes a delay in getting to a diagnosis that is not 
      made prior to rising signs, such as large abscess, neurological impairment or
      vertebral fractures. In these cases medical treatment alone did not show
      effective results, because no specific antibiotic drug can permeate the abscess's
      capsule, and an effective concentration is not achieved in the infection's site. 
      Therefore, surgical treatment is necessary to abscess draining and setting the
      correct medical treatment to mycobacterial eradication.

LID - S1529-9430(12)01300-9 [pii]
AB  - BACKGROUND CONTEXT: Postoperative spondylodiscitis (PSD) is a known complication 
      of lumbar disc surgery. The etiology of the disease is usually bacterial, but
      several uncommon infectious agents have also been described; however, there are
      no reports about postoperative colonization with Mycobacterium bovis bacille
      Calmette-Guerin after lumbar discectomy. PURPOSE: To describe the case of PSD
      caused by M. bovis BCG, and to discuss diagnostic and therapeutic interventions
      as well as possible pathogenic mechanisms of the disease. STUDY DESIGN: Case
      report and review of the literature. METHODS: A 31-year-old man was operated on
      because of L4-L5 lumbar disc herniation. Two months later, the patient presented 
      with gradual increase of back pain, and magnetic resonance imaging confirmed PSD.
      He started to receive antibacterial treatment and was reoperated on because of
      progressive neurological deficits due to epidural abscess. Neurological status
      improved, but a fistula developed with intermittent pus drainage from the
      operative scar. RESULTS: Microbiological cultures were repeatedly obtained from
      the pus, but all the initial stains and cultures were negative. Four months after
      the reoperation, the culture for M. bovis BCG from the pus appeared to be
      positive. The patient received antituberculosis regimen, including isoniazid,
      rifampin, ethambutol, and ofloxacin. The clinical symptoms resolved, and
      antituberculosis treatment was discontinued after 14 months. CONCLUSIONS:
      Mycobacterium bovis BCG must be considered in the differential diagnosis of PSD. 
      Microbiological analysis and radiological studies are vital components in
      diagnosis; if there is any suspicion of BCG osteomyelitis, proper diagnostic and 
      therapeutic management must be instituted without delay to avoid an unfavorable
      outcome.

AB  - Iliopsoas abscess (IPA) is rare in children, particularly in neonates. A male
      neonate was born at 38 weeks of gestation with a weight of 2915 g. On day 22
      after birth, his family noticed that his right thigh was swollen. Abdominal
      computed tomography showed a mass extending to the right iliopsoas from the right
      thigh with thick septa. Puncture to the right groin yielded purulent fluid, and
      so a diagnosis of abscess was made. The puncture was followed by surgical
      drainage through a small inguinal incision, and the abscess cavity was irrigated 
      thoroughly using normal saline. Culture of abscess fluid was positive for
      Streptococcus pneumoniae, so intravenous ABPC infusion was continued. The
      postoperative magnetic resonance imaging indicate that the IPA was derived from
      arthritis of the hip, and the patients received Riemenbugel for the incomplete
      hip dislocation. He is doing well at 2 years of age.

TI  - [Psoas abscess after ureteral stent exchange for cutaneous ureterostomy: report
      of a case].
PG  - 341-4
AB  - A 69-year-old man underwent a radical cystectomy and cutaneous ureterostomy for
      carcinoma in situ of the urinary bladder. The ureteral stents were exchanged for 
      cutaneous ureterostomy 35 days after the operation. The patient suffered from
      high fever with chills a few hours after the stent exchange, and was readmitted
      to our hospital. High fever was not improved by treatment with Ceftriaxone for 5 
      days. Five days after the stent exchange, computed tomography (CT) revealed a
      right psoas abscess. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was
      detected in the blood culture. Urine culture showed MRSA, Pseudomonas aeruginosa 
      and Enterococcus faecium. Computed tomography-guided percutaneous catheter
      drainage and treatment consisting of vancomycin, minocycline and ciprofloxacin
      were performed for the psoas abscess. This treatment significantly reduced the
      size of the abscess and high fever was improved. The catheter was removed 22 days
      after the drainage. However, magnetic resonance imaging revealed a spondylitis at
      L4 and L5. Therefore, antibiotics treatment was continued for about 3 months.
      There has been no sign of recurrence of bladder cancer and psoas abscess at 23
      months after the operation.

AB  - Spinal tuberculosis (TB) in children is uncommon. The authors report a case of a 
      3-year-old boy who was diagnosed with TB spondylitis. He presented to the
      hospital with a back mass, back pain and inability to walk. He failed to receive 
      TB prophylaxis after having been in close contact to his mother who had pulmonary
      TB. He received incision and drainage and continued on anti-TB regimens without
      complications. At 4-month follow-up, he was able to stand and walk without
      assistance. It is important to carry out contact investigations and provide TB
      prophylaxis to children who have had a history of contacting TB index cases to
      prevent TB disease and serious complications of TB infection.

PG  - S557-63
LID - 10.1007/s00586-012-2289-9 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Erysipelas is an animal disease caused by Gram-positive bacteria
      Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae. Among the domestic animals, domestic pig (Sus
      scrofa f. domestica) suffers most frequently from the disease in human
      environment. This is a typical animal-borne disease observed mainly in
      occupational groups employed in agriculture, farming (of animals and birds),
      fishing and manufacturing industry. METHODS: We are presenting the clinical
      course of infection (E. rhusiopathiae) and discuss clinical forms. E.
      rhusiopathiae in humans may have the following clinical course: mild form of skin
      infection diagnosed as local erythema (erysipeloid), disseminated form of skin
      infection and the most serious form of infection of systemic course (endocarditis
      and sepsis). Mild skin infection and local erythema are the most common forms.
      Very rare case of animal-borne infection course has been presented in which after
      initial phase the disease was generalised to the abscesses formation in
      paravertebral space, spondylitis and empyema formation in spinal canal. In the
      presented clinical case, the patient was suffering from diabetes. It was probably
      an additional risk factor of the disease generalisation. Patient underwent
      drainage of empyema in spinal canal, after which his neurological status
      gradually improved. Antibiotic therapy was implemented and continued for 8 weeks.
      Such course of erysipelas was not previously described in the literature.
      RESULTS: After therapy neurological status was improved. In follow MRI control
      exam empyema and spondylitis was successfully eliminated. CONCLUSIONS: Various
      complications of the disease, such as endocarditis and heart valves disturbances,
      are well known and are the most severe complications of the generalised
      infection. Proper targeted and long-term antibiotic therapy is crucial.

      abscess successfully treated by percutaneous drainage and systemic chemotherapy-a
      case report].
PG  - 1978-80
AB  - A 76-year-old woman was diagnosed of mucinous cystadenocarcinoma of the appendix.
      Since there was wide direct invasion into the right psoas muscle, she was judged 
      as inoperable although she had no bowel obstruction. She was received FOLFIRI and
      bevacizumab treatment. After the first cycle, the tumor progressed rapidly and
      formed the abdominal wall abscess at the right groin. Since she had a fever and
      pain at the right groin and the abscess reached the hypodermic, we put a drainage
      tube into the abscess. The tube was placed, which made her symptoms improved
      markedly. We have been continuing with FOLFIRI treatment and drainage for 10
      months without progressive disease. We report a rare case of the conservative
      therapy of mucinous cystadenocarcinoma of appendix with abdominal wall abscess.

TI  - [Iliopsoas abscess: therapeutic approach and outcome in a series of 35 patients].
PG  - 307-11
LID - 10.1016/j.eimc.2011.09.016 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The present study was aimed at reviewing the iliopsoas abscess
      (IPA) from a contemporary perspective, on the basis of experience from two
      tertiary referral centres. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We performed a retrospective
      analysis of 35 cases of IPA diagnosed between 1998 and 2009. Their clinical and
      microbiological features were recorded, as well as their long-term outcome
      according to the type of treatment: antibiotics alone (10 patients), or
      antibiotics plus percutaneous drainage or surgery (25 patients). RESULTS: Primary
      abscess occurred in 8 patients. The most frequent source of secondary abscesses
      was spondylodiscitis. The classic clinical triad (fever, pain and functional
      impairment) was present in 10 patients, with a median duration of symptoms before
      diagnosis of 12 days. Staphylococcus aureus was the most frequently isolated
      microorganism. At the end of a median follow-up of 454 days, the risk of poor
      outcome (related death and/or relapse) was higher among patients with diabetes
      mellitus (44.4% vs. 7.7%; P=.027), with no significant differences according to
      the therapeutic approach (20.0% in the group of antibiotics alone vs. 28.0% in
      the group with drainage or surgery). CONCLUSIONS: In our series, most cases of
      IPA were due to S. aureus and secondary to a skeletal source. Antibiotic therapy 
      seems effective in the long-term, although diabetic patients had a higher risk of
      relapse.

TI  - Management of recurrent cutaneous abscesses during therapy with infliximab.
PG  - 1993-6
LID - 10.1016/j.clinthera.2011.10.015 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Infliximab is a chimeric monoclonal antibody, belonging to the class 
      of anti-tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) agents, approved for the
      treatment of psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis. Drugs of this class are known to 
      be associated with an infective risk, probably because they interfere with
      inflammatory and immune response at different levels. Although cutaneous
      Staphylococcus aureus infections seem to be more frequent than any other
      infection in the course of anti-TNF-alpha treatment, only a few case reports in
      the literature deal with this side effect, and, in particular, with its
      management. OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to report a case of recurrent
      methicillin-sensitive S aureus (MSSA) cutaneous abscesses during therapy with
      infliximab and successful management. CASE SUMMARY: In July 2009, a 53-year-old
      white woman (weighing 85 kg) affected by psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis was
      administered infliximab (5 mg/kg IV), based upon clinical appearance and previous
      unsuccessful treatment with cyclosporine, methotrexate, etanercept, and
      adalimumab. Three days after the first 3 infusions (at weeks 0, 2, and 6) she
      complained about the recurrent onset of painful, erythematous, indurated, and
      pus-draining cutaneous nodules located on her abdomen. The swab always revealed
      the presence of MSSA, and antibiotic oral therapy with amoxicillin + clavulanic
      acid (875 + 125 mg BID for 7 days) was established, with complete resolution of
      the abscesses. Routine laboratory findings were in normal ranges, with the
      exception of an elevated erythrosedimentation rate and an increased white blood
      cell count (range, 13,000-15,000/mm(3)) with neutrophilia (range, 75%-80%). HIV
      infection was ruled out. In agreement with the infectious disease consultant, 1
      day before the fourth infusion, a prophylactic antibiotic therapy with
      amoxicillin + clavulanic acid (875 + 125 mg BID for 5 days) was added to the
      therapeutic regimen. This treatment schedule was successfully repeated at each
      following infusion (every 8 weeks), and no recurrence of skin abscesses was
      observed. The patient provided signed authorization for publication of this case.
      CONCLUSIONS: This case report describes a woman with psoriasis and psoriatic
      arthritis who developed MSSA skin abscesses after each of the first 3 infliximab 
      infusions, which did not recur for the next 6 infusions after amoxicillin +
      clavulanic acid was added to her regimen, pre- and 4 days postinfusion.
      Adequately designed, placebo-controlled, double-blind trials are needed to
      determine whether such prophylactic antibiotic treatment is well tolerated or
      effective for this common complication of therapy with anti-TNF-alpha agents,
      when withdrawal of the drug is not advisable, as in this case.

TI  - Iliopsoas abscess caused by Aspergillus fumigatus complicated by pulmonary
      aspergillosis.
PG  - 569-75
LID - 10.1007/s10156-011-0339-6 [doi]
AB  - We report a case of iliopsoas abscess caused by Aspergillus fumigatus with
      pulmonary complications. A 60-year-old man was admitted to the Showa University
      Hospital Department of Gastroenterology with fulminant hepatitis B on April 14,
      2010, and treated with steroids. Although fulminant hepatitis B was improved by
      steroid and symptomatic therapy, he developed a fever on hospital day 39. The
      chest X-ray film showed a nodular lesion in the right middle-lower lung field,
      and both the (1 --> 3)-beta-D: -glucan and Candida mannan antigen tests were
      positive. The beta-D: -glucan level increased despite treatment with fluconazole 
      and other drugs, including low-dose micafungin. Abdominal computed tomography
      showed a low-density area in the right iliopsoas muscle. He was then referred to 
      the Department of Clinical Infectious Diseases. A. fumigatus was isolated from
      the iliopsoas lesion and the pulmonary lesion after specimens were obtained by
      aspiration and bronchofiberscopy, respectively, leading to a diagnosis of fungal 
      iliopsoas abscess. Steroid therapy was tapered early, the abscess was drained,
      and the micafungin dose was increased. This treatment led to improvement of the
      fever, inflammatory reaction, beta-D: -glucan level, and lesions of the lung and 
      iliopsoas muscle. In preparation for discharge, treatment was changed to
      voriconazole (parenteral --> per oral) followed by itraconazole (per oral). His
      clinical course was satisfactory, and there was no recurrence after antifungal
      therapy was stopped. We conclude that after invasive pulmonary aspergillosis
      developed, A. fumigatus spread hematogenously to create an extremely rare
      iliopsoas abscess. The beta-D: -glucan level closely reflected the response to
      treatment and was useful for follow-up.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To describe the clinical characteristics of patients with abscess on 
      the psoas muscle (PA) and to identify the possible differences existing between
      pyogenic and tuberculous etiologies. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A retrospective review
      of patients diagnosed of PA in one hospital was conducted (1983-2009). Two groups
      were established, that is pyogenic and tuberculous, and the clinical findings,
      analyses and evolution were compared. RESULTS: Thirty PA were included, 83%
      pyogenic and 17% tuberculous, average age 53 years. On 9 occasions, 30% were
      primary and on 21 occasions, 70% secondary (to skeletal pathology in 8, to
      urological in 8 and to gastrointestinal in 8). No clinical differences were
      observed between both groups. Pyogenic and tuberculous etiologies were
      differentiated analytically through leukocyte values (13,871 vs. 8,560/mm(3),
      p=0.018), hemoglobin (11 vs. 14 g/dL, p=0.008) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate
      (ESR) (108 vs. 17 mm/h, p<0.0001). Abscesses were diagnosed by computed
      tomography (CT) in 29 patients (97%) and by magnetic resonance in 1 (3%), both
      with a diagnostic sensitivity of 100%, as opposed to 50% for ultrasound scanning.
      Left laterality was less frequent in pyogenic abscesses (44% vs. 100%, p=0.031). 
      The blood cultures were positive in 22% and abscess pus culture in 82%. Gram
      negative bacilli, Streptococcus spp. and S. aureus were the most frequent
      isolations. A total of 67% were drained: transcutaneously 50%, surgically 13% and
      both techniques 3%. Two patients died (7%), both with pyogenic abscess.
      CONCLUSIONS: Secondary pyogenic abscesses constitute the most frequent PA group. 
      CT is the diagnostic procedure of choice. Leukocytosis, anemia, raised ESR and
      right laterality suggest pyogenic etiology. Transcutaneous drainage is
      substituting surgical drainage and also makes it possible to obtain diagnostic
      samples.

PG  - 718-21
AB  - A 37-year-old woman with acute lymphoblastic leukemia developed fever and
      pneumonia during persistent neutropenia after consolidation chemotherapy.
      Pneumonia was rapidly followed by the formation of abscess in adjacent
      subcutaneous tissues, muscles and bones. She subsequently developed sudden onset 
      of paraplegia and loss of all sensation below Th4. Epidural abscess was detected 
      by MRI. Emergency drainage was performed, but the patient died 4 days after the
      operation. Rhizopus oryzae grew from culture of the epidural abscess. Since the
      incidence of zygomycosis appears to have increased over the recent years,
      clinicians should be aware of the possibility of zygomycosis in case of any
      infection that is resistant to antibiotics.

TI  - Tubercular spinal epidural abscess involving the dorsal-lumbar-sacral region
      without osseous involvement.
PG  - 544-9
AB  - Musculoskeletal tuberculosis is known for its ability to present in various forms
      and guises at different sites. Tubercular spinal epidural abscess (SEA) is an
      uncommon infectious entity. Its presence without associated osseous involvement
      may be considered an extremely rare scenario. We present a rare case of
      tubercular SEA in an immune-competent 35-year-old male patient. The patient
      presented with acute cauda equina syndrome and was shown to have multisegmental
      SEA extending from D5 to S2 vertebral level without any evidence of vertebral
      involvement on MRI. The patient made an uneventful recovery following surgical
      decompression and antitubercular chemotherapy. The diagnosis was confirmed by
      histopathological demonstration of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in drained pus.
      Such presentation of tubercular SEA has not been reported previously in the
      English language based medical literature to the best of our knowledge.

TI  - [A case of type 2 diabetes mellitus complicated with left iliopsoas abscess
      caused by a left femoral vein catheter during treatment for right pyothorax and
      right subphrenic abscess].
PG  - 180-4
AB  - A 78-year-old man was receiving regular treatment for diabetes and dementia at
      our hospital. Diabetes was diagnosed about 10 years previously, at which time the
      patient's HbA(1)c level had been maintained at 6% by diet therapy and an oral
      hypoglycemic agent. In July, 2008, he was admitted with fever and hospitalized
      for pneumonia, which improved with antibiotic treatment and chest drainage.
      However, pyothorax developed, and in October, 2008 he was admitted again with
      fever and inflammation. A chest computed tomography (CT) scan revealed a right
      subphrenic abscess, which improved with antibiotic treatment. He was readmitted
      for fever and lumbago in November, 2008, and an abdominal CT scan showed a left
      iliopsoas abscess that did not improve with antibiotic treatment, and had
      increased in size. Due to infection from the central vein catheter in the left
      femoral vein inserted at the end of October, the catheter was withdrawn at the
      end of November. There was a rapid reduction of the left iliopsoas abscess, his
      inflammation and lumbago symptoms reduced, and he was discharged in January 2009.
      In cases of dementia in elderly with diabetes, a catheter from a femoral vein is 
      frequently used to prevent complications. However, this method has been known to 
      result in infection at the site of the catheter, and to cause fever. The
      circumstances of this case strongly support the removal of such a catheter in
      elderly patients at the first indication of persistent infection.

TI  - Increasing incidence of iliopsoas abscesses with MRSA as a predominant pathogen.
PG  - 1-7
LID - 10.1016/j.jinf.2011.05.008 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Iliopsoas abscesses (IPAs) are rare infections involving purulence
      within the muscles of the iliopsoas compartment, seldom due to
      Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) historically. This study was
      designed to evaluate the clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients with
      IPAs. METHODS: A retrospective analysis of the demographics, clinical
      presentation, microbiologic data and treatment modalities among patients with
      IPAs from 1993 to 2007 at The Johns Hopkins Hospital was performed. RESULTS:
      Among 61 patients with IPAs, infection rates increased from 0.5 cases/10,000
      admissions (1993-2004) to 6.5 cases/10,000 admissions (2005-2007) (P < 0.001). An
      adjacent infectious focus was identified in 80% of patients, from skeletal (48%),
      intra-abdominal (23%), vascular (5%), genitourinary (3%), and cutaneous sources
      (2%). During 2005-2007, MRSA became a predominant pathogen, accounting for 25% of
      all cases and 37% of cases with a definitive microbiologic diagnosis (P = 0.006).
      Patients with IPAs >2 cm were more likely to undergo drainage, with trends toward
      longer hospitalizations, longer antibiotic courses, and increased odds of
      securing a definitive microbiologic diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: Since 2005, rates of 
      IPA have dramatically increased, with MRSA now the leading cause of infection.
      Knowledge of common pathogens should guide antimicrobial therapy including
      empiric coverage for MRSA in institutions with similar populations, especially if
      culture data are not available.

LID - 10.1016/j.pediatrneurol.2010.10.017 [doi]
AB  - Congenital dermal sinuses result from abnormal neurulation, and are uncommon. A
      spinal intramedullary abscess secondary to an infected dermoid cyst is very rare,
      and the functional prognosis is usually quite poor. We report on a 16-month-old
      child with tetraplegia secondary to intramedullary abscesses because of a dermoid
      cyst infection associated with a dermal sinus. The abscesses were drained, and
      the dermoid cyst was removed. Antibiotics were administered for 6 weeks after
      neurosurgery. The child was followed at a pediatric rehabilitation department.
      After 1 year, he was able to walk quickly and had regained appropriate upper limb
      motor function for his age. However, bladder sphincter dyssynergia persisted,
      requiring intermittent catheterization. This case highlights the importance of
      early diagnosis for surgical intervention and prolonged antibiotic therapy.
      Long-term follow-up by a multidisciplinary team allowed for the effective
      management of related neurologic, orthopedic, and bladder disorders.

TI  - Harvey Cushing, the spine surgeon: the surgical treatment of Pott disease.
PG  - 1420-5
LID - 10.1097/BRS.0b013e3181f2a2c6 [doi]
AB  - STUDY DESIGN: Review of historical archival records. OBJECTIVE: Describe Harvey
      Cushing's patients with spinal pathology. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Harvey
      Cushing was a pioneer of modern surgery but his work on spine remains largely
      unknown. METHODS: Review of the Chesney Medical Archives of the Johns Hopkins
      Hospital from 1896 to 1912. RESULTS: This is the first time that Cushing's spinal
      cases while he was at the Johns Hopkins Hospital, including those with Pott
      disease, have been described.Cushing treated three young men with psoas abscesses
      secondary to Pott disease during his residency: he drained the abscesses,
      debrided any accompanying necrotic vertebral bodies, irrigated the cavity with
      salt, and left the incision open to close by secondary intention. Although
      Cushing used Koch's "tuberculin therapy" (of intravenous administration of
      isolated tubercular bacilli) in one patient, he did not do so in the other two,
      likely because of the poor response of this first patient. Later in his tenure,
      Cushing performed a laminectomy on a patient with kyphosis and paraplegia
      secondary to Pott disease. CONCLUSION: These cases provide a view of Cushing
      early in his career, pointing to the extraordinary degree of independence that he
      had during his residency under William Steward Halsted; these cases may have been
      important in the surgical upbringing both of Cushing and his coresident, William 
      Stevenson Baer, who became the first professor of Orthopedics at Johns Hopkins
      Hospital. At the turn of the last century, Pott disease was primarily treated by 
      immobilization with bed rest, braces, and plaster-of-paris jackets; some surgeons
      also employed gradual correction of the deformity by hyperextension. Patients who
      failed a trial of conservative therapy (of months to years) were treated with a
      laminectomy. However, the limitations of these strategies led to the development 
      of techniques that form the basis of contemporary spine surgery-instrumentation
      and fusion.

AB  - Pott's disease, or tuberculosis of the spine, is the most common osteoarticular
      tuberculosis. Among them, dorsolumbar impairment is predominant. The authors
      report the case of a patient with a huge cold lumbar abscess associated with
      Pott's disease. The patient is a 32-year-old man presenting dorsolumbar
      tumefaction associated with an alteration in his general condition and fever for 
      three months. Treatment by "traditional healers" did not provide any improvement.
      He consulted for mild lumbar pain triggered by fatigue appearing one week before 
      and after the failure of the traditional practitioner. The clinical examination
      found a temperature of 38.5 degrees C, cachexia, mild lumber kyphosis and
      impressive, soft, painless and non inflammatory dorsolumbar bruised tumefaction, 
      40 cm high, 15 cm wide and 7 cm deep. He did not present any neurological signs. 
      The dorsolumbar X-ray of the spine revealed a lesion associated with Pott's
      disease in the first and second lumbar vertebrae with pinching of the disc,
      punched-out lesions and osteocondensation. The ultrasound examination of the soft
      tissue revealed the presence of a laterovertebral collection of fluid diffusing
      in the subcutaneous region. The psoas major and the paravertebral muscles were
      not affected. A scan or MRI of the spine was not carried out. Examination of the 
      tissue sample and drainage of the abscess confirmed the tubercular origin.
      Treatment with tuberculostatic drugs for 12 months associated with immobilisation
      resulted in a cure with sequelae of mild kyphoscoliosis vertebral statics.

TI  - Psoas abscess with associated septic arthritis of the hip in infants.
PG  - 2440-3
LID - 10.1016/j.jpedsurg.2010.07.052 [doi]
AB  - We describe psoas abscess with concomitant septic hip arthritis in 2 infants, 3
      and 7 months old. The common clinical features were a palpable mass in the
      inguinal region, irritable hip, and delayed treatment. The diagnosis of septic
      hip was delayed in one child, and they both had residual hip deformity at
      follow-up. It is possible that initial delay in diagnoses resulted in the
      concurrent pathologic condition because of spread of infection. These 2 cases
      demonstrate the first known reports of concurrent psoas abscess and septic hip
      arthritis in infancy. Magnetic resonance imaging is a valuable method to identify
      these concurrent pathologic conditions. A proposed etiologic mechanism is also
      discussed in the article.

TI  - Cervical facet joint septic arthritis: a case report.
PG  - 182-7
AB  - Facet joint septic arthritis is a rare but severe infection with the possibility 
      of significant morbidity resulting from local or systemic spread of the
      infection. Pain is the most common complaint on presentation followed by fever,
      then neurologic impairment. While the lumbar spine is involved in the vast
      majority of cases presented in the literature, the case presented here occurred
      in the cervical spine. The patient presented with a three week history of neck
      and left shoulder pain and was diagnosed by MRI when his pain did not respond to 
      analgesics and muscle relaxants. The only predisposing factor was a history of
      diabetes mellitus and the infection most likely resulted from hematogenous
      spread. MRI is highly sensitive in diagnosing septic arthritis and it is the
      preferred modality for demonstrating the extent of infection and secondary
      complications including epidural and paraspinal abscesses as seen in this case.
      Without familiarity with this entity's predisposing factors, clinical symptoms
      and appropriate lab/imaging work up, many patients experience a delay in
      diagnosis. Treatment involves long term parenteral antibiotics or percutaneous
      drainage. Surgical debridement is reserved for cases with severe neurologic
      impairment. The incidence of facet joint septic arthritis is increasing likely
      related to patient factors (increasing number of patients >50 yo,
      immunosuppressed patients, etc), advancement in imaging technology, availability 
      of MRI, and heightened awareness of this rare infection which is the aim of this 
      case presentation.

AB  - A 10-year-old boy presented with a 2.5-week history of right leg pain and limp. A
      right flank mass was noted by a parent on the day of presentation. The child's
      past medical history was remarkable for perforated appendicitis treated with an
      interval laparoscopic appendectomy 2 years before this presentation. Abdominal
      and pelvic computed tomography revealed a retroperitoneal mass with
      calcifications, suggestive of a retained appendicolith with abscess formation.
      This case illustrates the importance of considering very late complications of
      appendicitis in patients presenting with fever and abdominal or flank pain or
      masses.

PG  - 387-9
AB  - Infectious complications of sickle cell disease are common and can be serious and
      difficult to diagnose. Epidemiological aspects of these infections are well
      documented. The most common germ in children is pneumococcus followed by
      Haemophilus influenzae and minor salmonella. In adults gram-negative germs
      including minor salmonella are the most frequent. The purpose of this report is
      to describe a case of a Citrobacter freundii spondylitis with prevertebral
      abscess extending to dorsal and lumbar spinal areas. Diagnosis was made during
      work-up for persistent vaso-occlusive manifestations. Treatment consisted of
      percutaneous lumbar drainage associated with antibiotherapy.

TI  - Cervical epidural abscess presenting with Brown-Sequard syndrome in a patient
      with type 2 diabetes.
PG  - 1391-3
AB  - An 80-year-old woman with type 2 diabetes was admitted due to right-handed muscle
      weakness. The patient presented with Brown-Sequard syndrome, with complete
      paralysis of the right lower limb along with a loss of pain and temperature
      sensations in the left lower limb. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a cervical
      epidural abscess, and accompanying edema or inflammation of the right side of the
      spinal cord at the C5 level. She underwent drainage and evacuation of the spinal 
      abscess, followed by intravenous antibiotic administration. These interventions
      ameliorated the neurological deficits. The present case suggests the importance
      of epidural abscess as a rare pathogenetic cause of Brown-Sequard syndrome in
      type 2 diabetes.

TI  - Randomized controlled trial of minimally invasive surgery using acellular dermal 
      matrix for complex anorectal fistula.
PG  - 3279-86
AB  - AIM: To compare the efficacy and safety of acellular dermal matrix (ADM)
      bioprosthetic material and endorectal advancement flap (ERAF) in treatment of
      complex anorectal fistula. METHODS: Ninety consecutive patients with complex
      anorectal fistulae admitted to Anorectal Surgical Department of First Affiliated 
      Hospital, Xinjiang Medical University from March 2008 to July 2009, were enrolled
      in this study. Complex anorectal fistula was diagnosed following its clinical,
      radiographic, or endoscopic diagnostic criteria. Under spinal anesthesia,
      patients underwent identification and irrigation of the fistula tracts using
      hydrogen peroxide. ADM was securely sutured at the secondary opening to the
      primary opening using absorbable suture. Outcomes of ADM and ERAF closure were
      compared in terms of success rate, fecal incontinence rate, anorectal deformity
      rate, postoperative pain time, closure time and life quality score. Success was
      defined as closure of all external openings, absence of drainage without further 
      intervention, and absence of abscess formation. Follow-up examination was
      performed 2 d, 2, 4, 6, 12 wk, and 5 mo after surgery, respectively. RESULTS: No 
      patient was lost to follow-up. The overall success rate was 82.22% (37/45) 5.7 mo
      after surgery. ADM dislodgement occurred in 5 patients (11.11%), abscess
      formation was found in 1 patient, and fistula recurred in 2 patients. Of the 13
      patients with recurrent fistula using ERAF, 5 (11.11%) received surgical drainage
      because of abscess formation. The success rate, postoperative pain time and
      closure time of ADM were significantly higher than those of ERAF (P < 0.05).
      However, no difference was observed in fecal incontinence rate and anorectal
      deformity rate after treatment with ADM and ERAF. CONCLUSION: Closure of fistula 
      tract opening with ADM is an effective procedure for complex anorectal fistula.
      ADM should be considered a first line treatment for patients with complex
      anorectal fistula.

TI  - Pancreatic involvement in melioidosis.
PG  - 365-8
AB  - CONTEXT: Melioidosis is endemic to tropical regions and, despite the common
      occurrence of intra-abdominal abscesses, pancreatic involvement in melioidosis
      has not previously been reported. OBJECTIVE: We report our experience with
      pancreatic melioidosis. PATIENTS: All 65 patients treated for melioidosis who had
      computed tomography (CT) scans were identified from prospective databases and
      were retrospectively reviewed. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: A detailed review of cases 
      with pancreas involvement was carried out. RESULTS: There were four cases (three 
      males and one female; median age 29.5 years, range: 25-48 years) with pancreatic 
      melioidosis, giving a prevalence of 6.2%. All had predisposing conditions (two
      had poorly controlled diabetes mellitus and two had thalassemia) for melioidosis.
      Fever (100%), anorexia (100%), weight loss (100%), rigor (75%) and abdominal pain
      (75%) were the most common symptoms at presentation and the median duration of
      symptoms before presentation was six weeks (range: 2-8 weeks). All pancreatic
      abscesses were detected on CT scan. Multiple foci involvement was common (3 to 6 
      sites): blood (4 patients), liver (3 patients), psoas muscle (2 patients), spleen
      (2 patients), infected ascites (2 patients) and lung (1 patient). Pancreatic
      involvement ranged from multi-focal micro-abscesses to focal large abscesses and 
      involved all parts of the pancreas (body 100%, head 75% and tail 50%). Associated
      pancreatic findings included splenic vein thrombosis, peripancreatic inflammation
      and peripancreatic fat streaking. All the pancreatic abscesses were resolved with
      antibiotics without requiring pancreatic abscess drainage (including one patient 
      who died from disseminated melioidosis). CONCLUSION: Pancreatic involvement
      typically occurs as part of multi-organ involvement and commonly manifests as
      multifoci micro-abscesses. Associated pancreatic abnormalities were also common. 
      All responded to treatment without requiring drainage.

TI  - Septicemia of unknown origin causing by Streptococcus agalactiae primary psoas
      abscess: a case report.
PG  - 735-8
AB  - Staphylococcus aureus is the commonest organism resulting in primary psoas
      abscesses. However non-staphylococcal primary psoas abscesses have increasingly
      been published in the literature. Here, the author reports a case of primary
      psoas abscess in a type II diabetic woman previously diagnosed Streptococcus
      agalactiae septicemia of unknown origin, which rapidly responded to penicillin
      plus clindamycin and prompt surgical drainage. Diabetic patients are not only
      susceptible to soft tissue infection but also primary psoas abscess caused by
      Streptococcus agalactiae.

TI  - Acute osteomyelitis in children: the pathogenesis revisited?
PG  - 268-75
LID - 10.1016/j.otsr.2009.12.012 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE OF THE STUDY: The present study reviews our experience of acute
      hematogenous osteomyelitis in 450 children over a period of 20 years from 1985 to
      2004 at the Noumea Territorial Hospital in New Caledonia. The objective was to
      formulate a new theory of the pathogenesis of this affection and to report our
      research on the disparity in the pathology between temperate countries and our
      own tropical Pacific area. PATIENT AND METHODS: Only children with an initially
      normal X-ray and showing symptoms for less than one week were included in the
      study. Subacute osteomyelitis, infant osteoarthritis and spinal and sacroiliac
      joint infections were all excluded. All children were treated according to a
      preestablished protocol including: clinical examination; blood tests; ultrasound,
      to determine the presence and size of the periosteal elevation and to exclude
      soft tissue abscess and frequent pyomyositis. Ultrasound was used in the decision
      to treat with antibiotics alone or with surgery. Computed Tomography was used for
      deep structures assessment and medical therapy guidance Surgery was limited to
      open drainage of the subperiosteal abscess only. Regular follow-up of outpatients
      was continued until normal blood test and X-ray results were achieved. RESULTS
      AND DISCUSSION: Four hundred and fifty children with a diagnosis of acute
      hematogenous osteomyelitis were identified, giving an average incidence of 22 new
      cases per year (range, 12-35). This incidence was two to five times as high as
      found in Europe. Fifty-three percent of our cases required surgical drainage (vs.
      20 % in Europe). Ethnically, 60 % of the children were Melanesian and 20 %
      Polynesian (both represented less than 50 % of the local population). A similar
      incidence, about four times as high as in the population of European descent, was
      reported in Polynesians by our neighbors in New Zealand. The limbs were affected 
      in 90 % of cases, and specifically lower limbs in 70 %. Multiple osseous lesions 
      and systemic infection were recorded in 43 children (9.5 %). Blood cultures and
      surgical samples were positive in 80 % of cases, and otherwise negative. All the 
      children were successfully treated, without chronic evolution or sequelae needing
      secondary surgery. The predominant microorganisms isolated were Staphylococcus
      aureus, in 81 % of cases, none of which were methicillin-resistant, and group A
      Streptococcus in 7.5 % of cases. A previous study of soft-tissue S. aureus
      infection showed the presence of Panton-Valentine Leukocidin (PVL) genes in 89 % 
      of cases. These very infrequent genes are responsible for leukotoxic apoptosis,
      producing leukocidin, causing local acute aggressiveness. A parallel study, in
      progress for more than a year, is focusing on detecting PVL genes in S. aureus
      isolated from acute osteomyelitis: in the first nine children analyzed, PVL genes
      were likewise detected in 89 % of the S. aureus isolated, with no methicillin
      resistance. Ultrasonography allowed positive diagnosis in 64 % of cases on the
      day of admission and 84 % by the second day. Because of this very early presence 
      of subperiosteal abscess at the beginning of the disease, and several other
      issues raised in the present study, we believe that Trueta's theory of acute
      osteomyelitis pathogenesis does not provide any logical explanation for our
      anatomoclinical observations. We believe that the primary focus of infection is
      in the osteoperiosteal area rather than under the growth plate in the metaphyseal
      bone. The term of Acute Osteo-Periostitis would therefore be much more suitable. 
      A history of blunt trauma was found in 63 % of cases in the present series, and
      often reported in the literature. We speculate that two forms of infection
      fixation may develop: a local form, where bacteria carried by the blood stream
      reach a subperiosteal edema or hematoma secondary to blunt trauma, which is in
      our opinion the most frequent cause; and a general form, where fixation occurs as
      single or multifocal osteoperiostitis, and multivisceral locations in severe
      forms of septicemia. The disparity in this pathology between temperate countries 
      and our own tropical Pacific area is certainly due to PVL-positive S. aureus and 
      ethnic factors. The high prevalence of Melanesian and Polynesian patients
      confirms that they are at high risk of musculoskeletal infection in New Caledonia
      as in other Pacific countries, and it is possible that these ethnic groups are
      genetically susceptible to PVL-positive strains. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level IV.

TI  - [Two cases of psoas abscesses caused by group A beta-haemolytic streptococcal
      infection with a cutaneous portal of entry].
PG  - 369-72
LID - 10.1016/j.annder.2010.02.020 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Psoas abscess is a rare clinical entity that occurs chiefly after
      intra-abdominal or retroperitoneal infection. We report two cases of psoas
      abscesses caused by group A beta-haemolytic streptococcal infection having a
      cutaneous portal of entry. CASE REPORTS: The first patient, a 50-year-old man,
      was feverish and had ulcerative and necrotic cutaneous lesions evocative of
      ecthyma that were progressing for three months and were recently associated with 
      a painful mass in the left iliac fossa, leading to difficulties in walking. The
      second patient, a 35-year-old woman with a medical history of intravenous drug
      addiction, was admitted to intensive care for sepsis syndrome following group A
      beta-haemolytic streptococcal infection with a cutaneous portal of entry
      (swelling on left lower limb). She remained unaccountably subfebrile 10 days
      after the start of antibiotic therapy with amoxicillin. Abdominal CAT scans for
      each patient confirmed the diagnosis of left psoas abscess. For the first
      patient, the same group A beta-haemolytic streptococcus was isolated in drainage 
      fluid and at the cutaneous injury site. The outcome was favourable in both cases 
      following extensive intravenous antibiotic therapy (amoxicillin) combined with
      percutaneous drainage (in the first case). DISCUSSION: Psoas abscess can occur
      after locoregional infection and the portals of entry are usually
      gastro-intestinal, musculoskeletal or genitourinary, with many organisms capable 
      of causing such secondary abscesses. Psoas abscess can also be a primary clinical
      event. Staphylococcus aureus is the most common causative organism. The presented
      cases comprised secondary psoas abscesses with a cutaneous portal of entry. Since
      the complete set of three evocative symptoms (prolonged fever, pain and psoitis) 
      is frequently seen late, diagnosis must be made on the basis of prolonged
      infectious state or unaccountable feverish abdominal pain. Diagnosis is based on 
      abdominal CAT scan and treatment involves the use of appropriate antibiotics as
      well as percutaneous or surgical drainage of the abscess. The mortality rate in
      this patient population remains high with survival being dependent on prompt
      initiation of therapy.

AB  - Infectious complications are the top causes of morbidity and mortality in
      patients who undergo renal transplantation. We report a patient who received a
      cadaveric renal transplant in Mainland China. One year post-transplantation, the 
      patient had right buttock pain with radiation to the leg. Swelling and tenderness
      over the right groin was also found. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a
      multilobulated cystic lesion, about 8 x 7 cm, at the right iliac fossa and
      presacral region extending to the posterior aspect of the graft kidney and up to 
      the right psoas muscle. Drainage of the intra-abdominal abscess was performed.
      The abscess culture showed presence of Aspergillus spp. The patient had received 
      steroids, tacrolimus and mycophenolate mofetil, which could be a risk factor for 
      fungal infection. The cause of Aspergillus infection in our patient remains
      unclear. It may have been due to immune system insufficiency of the patient
      rendering the patient prone to infection. Pseudoaneurysm formation of the
      internal iliac artery following Aspergillus infection after kidney
      transplantation is rarely reported. Although it is a dilemma, once a severe
      situation such as pseudoaneurysm with aspergillosis presents, graft removal is
      suggested.

AB  - A 64-year-old woman presented with severe infection accompanied by iliosacral
      arthritis and retroperitoneal abscess after tension-free vaginal mesh
      reconstruction using polypropylene meshes (GyneMesh; Gynecare, Ethicon,
      Somerville, NJ, USA) for pelvic organ prolapsed quantification of stage 3 pelvic 
      organ prolapse. Three weeks after the operation, she complained of high fever (39
      degrees C) and sharp pain from the left buttock down to the left lower limb.
      Computed tomography revealed a retroperitoneal abscess and osteolysis caused by
      iliosacral arthritis. Because the infection was not resolved by drainage and
      antibiotic therapy, the left portion of the mesh was removed. She recovered after
      mesh removal, and no recurrent abscess was observed in the CT after a 6-month
      follow-up. However, the patient complained of sporadic discomfort in the left
      buttock, and a blood examination performed during this period, revealed a slight 
      elevation in the C-reactive protein level. Although this symptom was resolved by 
      oral antibiotics, further follow-up was required.

AB  - The aim of this retrospective study was to investigate the effect of adjuvant
      hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) therapy on the duration of antibiotic treatment and rate 
      of radiological improvement in the management of spinal tuberculosis. We reviewed
      a total of 51 patients with tuberculous spondylitis of the spine who were treated
      by percutaneous abscess drainage or radical surgical debridement with
      chemotherapy, and of whom 16 randomly selected patients also received adjuvant
      HBO therapy and 35 did not. Serological markers were monitored in the course of
      treatment. Percutaneous needle biopsy was performed on each patient before
      treatment. Spine and chest radiographs, CT scans and MRI were performed.
      Infection control was achieved in all patients and no recurrence occured. To our 
      knowledge this is the first reported series of patients with spinal tuberculosis 
      treated with HBO therapy as an adjunct to antituberculous chemotherapy. This
      combination provided earlier clinical and radiologic improvement than
      chemotherapy alone.

TI  - Management of a spontaneous spinal epidural abscess: a single-center 10-year
      experience.
PG  - 919-23; discussion 923-4
LID - 10.1227/01.NEU.0000356972.97356.C5 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: There is significant debate in the literature regarding the optimal
      management of patients with the diagnosis of a spinal epidural abscess (SEA).
      Although some have advocated conservative treatment with intravenous antibiotics 
      alone in select patients, recent studies have shown that patients treated without
      early surgery are more likely to have poor outcomes. METHODS: In this study, we
      review patients treated at a tertiary medical center with a spontaneous SEA. A
      total of 104 patients had a diagnosis of an SEA over a 10-year period. More than 
      half of these patients presented with back pain alone and no objective motor
      weakness. Sixty-four patients (61.5%) were treated conservatively with computed
      tomography-guided aspiration or antibiotics alone based on blood cultures,
      whereas 40 patients (38.5%) underwent surgical decompression. RESULTS: Of the
      patients managed nonoperatively, 11% improved, 64% remained stable, and 17% died.
      Conversely, of the patients treated with surgery, 25% improved, 43% remained
      stable, and 23% died. Review of the imaging studies revealed that 65.4% of
      patients had a ventral SEA, whereas 34.6% had a dorsal SEA. Although there were
      no statistically significant differences between these 2 groups in terms of
      management or outcome, 30.6% of the patients with a dorsal SEA were paraplegic or
      quadriplegic, and only 7.3% of the patients with a ventral SEA were paraplegic or
      quadriplegic (P = 0.003). CONCLUSION: Our data do not support the hypothesis that
      patients treated without early surgery are more likely to have a poor outcome.
      Furthermore, we propose that the anatomy of the SEA (ventral or dorsal) should
      play an important role in determining the treatment plan.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Necrotizing fasciitis of the thigh due to the colon cancer,
      especially during chemotherepy, has not been previously reported. CASE
      PRESENTATION: A 67-year-old man admitted to the hospital was diagnosed with
      sigmoid colon cancer that had spread to the left psoas muscle. Multiple hepatic
      metastases were also found, and combination chemotherapy with irinotecan and S-1 
      was administered. Four months after the initiation of chemotherapy, the patient
      developed gait disturbance and high fever and was therefore admitted to the
      emergency department of our hospital. Blood examination revealed generalized
      inflammation with a high C-reactive protein level. Computed tomography of the
      abdomen and pelvis showed gas and fluid collection in the retroperitoneum
      adjacent to the sigmoid colon cancer. The abscess was locally drained under
      computed tomographic guidance; however, the infection continued to spread and
      necrotizing fasciitis developed. Consequently, emergent debridement was
      performed. The patient recovered well, and the primary tumor was resected after
      remission of the local inflammation. CONCLUSION: Necrotizing fasciitis of the
      thigh due to the spread of sigmoid colon cancer is unusual, but this fatal
      complication should be considered during chemotherapy for patients with
      unresectable colorectal cancer.

TI  - Group C streptococcal psoas abscess associated with a homolateral hip joint
      prosthesis infection: a case report.
PG  - 361-5
AB  - An abscess in the psoas muscle is rare and frequently misdiagnosed. A delay in
      the diagnosis can increase its mortality rate. Some clinical signs can help the
      clinician but they all are not always present, and not at the same time. We
      describe in this paper a case report of an association between a psoas abscess
      and a homolateral hip joint prosthesis infection. It was suspected because of no 
      improvement in clinical state despite treatment of the abscess by antibiotics and
      drainage, and it required finally other complementary therapeutic solutions. The 
      pathogenic microorganism was a group C streptococcus. We discuss all these points
      and thereafter we suggest some recommendations for the clinician.

TI  - PEEK cage cervical ventral fusion in spondylodiscitis.
PG  - 1537-41
LID - 10.1007/s00701-009-0486-z [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Cervical spondylodiscitis is a quite rare finding regarding the number
      and the common location of spinal abscesses in the lumbar region. While in
      thoracic and lumbar discitis, single-step surgery with neural decompression, disc
      space evacuation, and subsequent fusion is well known, there is no such report in
      cervical discitis. Here the authors present their experience with ventral
      polyetherketone (PEEK) cage fusion in cervical spondylodiscitis in a single-step 
      procedure. METHODS: Between January 2006 and November 2008, five patients (three 
      men, two woman; ages 71, 77, 58, 66 and 66 years) suffering from cervical
      spondylodiscitis and epidural abscess underwent disc evacuation, myelon
      decompression and subsequent ventral fusion using an empty PEEK cage disc
      replacement in one single setting. All five patients presented with significant
      neurological symptoms like cervicobrachialgia, tetraparesis and disturbance of
      the urinary incontinence. In all five patients, disc evacuation, myelon
      decompression and cervical fusion using a PEEK cage disc replacement in a
      single-stage surgery were performed. All wounds were closed primarily.
      Postoperatively, all patients received a specific antibiotic therapy for at least
      6 weeks. RESULTS: This treatment strategy was successful in all patients with
      respect to clinical signs, laboratory parameters and radiological findings. All
      patients improved neurologically. Follow-up revealed a stable osteosynthesis
      without signs of instability. One cage was explanted despite neurological
      improvement and normal infectious parameters at another surgical department. No
      complications were observed. CONCLUSIONS: In all, abscess drainage and ventral
      fusion with PEEK-cage disc replacement in one single setting was proven to be a
      successful treatment option in cervical discitis and spinal epidural abscess.

PG  - 227-30
AB  - A 25-year-old man with a 3-year history of ankylosing spondylitis presented with 
      a sudden onset of pain in his left thigh. His ankylosing spondylitis had been
      treated for 2 years with the tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) antagonist 
      infliximab. The initial diagnosis was a muscular tear, and non-steroidal
      anti-inflammatory drugs were prescribed. 40 days later, the patient had tender
      swelling with warmth and light redness on his left thigh. His knee function had
      decreased markedly. His C-reactive protein level was 320 mg/l and white cell
      count was 30.4 x10(9)/l, indicating severe infection. Magnetic resonance imaging 
      revealed a loculated fluid collection in the quadriceps musculature measuring 30 
      cm. Hyperintensity seen on T1-weighted images was suggestive of infection. The
      infliximab therapy was stopped and repeated debridement and drainage performed,
      with about 2.5 litres of pus evacuated. Flucloxacillin was administered for 2
      weeks. The wound was closed 9 days later. The patient was discharged 20 days
      after surgery. An alternative immunosuppressive therapy--abatacept--was
      introduced. At the 18-month follow-up, the patient reported only light discomfort
      in the thigh during exercise, with a mildly impaired range of knee movement. No
      infectious complications recurred.

      muscle abscesses.
PG  - e1-4
LID - 10.1016/j.spinee.2009.06.013 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND CONTEXT: Salmonella vertebral osteomyelitis is a well-known
      complication of sickle cell disease. However, it has been infrequently reported
      in immunologically normal people or diabetic patients. PURPOSE: To report a case 
      of Salmonella vertebral osteomyelitis in a diabetic patient with multiple rib
      infections, large bilateral psoas muscle abscesses, and pleural effusion. STUDY
      DESIGN/SETTING: Case report. METHODS: A case of Salmonella vertebral
      osteomyelitis is reported in a 42-year-old man with diabetes. The patient had
      multiple rib and T12 vertebral infections with pleural effusion and large
      bilateral psoas muscle abscesses. The adjacent discs were intact. RESULTS:
      Diagnosis was made by computed tomography-guided psoas muscle abscess drainage
      and aspirate culture. Appropriate antibiotic treatment resulted in a favorable
      outcome. The patient had mild back pain with a 38 degrees residual kyphosis at
      his thoracolumbar junction after treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Vertebral osteomyelitis 
      caused by Salmonella is uncommon in diabetic patients. Salmonella can cause
      multiple bone infections and large abscesses of psoas muscles in patients without
      sickle cell disease. Correct diagnosis can be confirmed by blood, biopsy, or
      abscess culture. Appropriate antibiotic treatment was effective.

TI  - The study of clinical manifestation of osteoarticular tuberculosis in Siriraj
      Hospital, Thailand.
PG  - S101-9
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study of clinical manifestations of osteoarticular tuberculosis.
      MATERIAL AND METHOD: This study is an observational retrospective study design
      from the electronic medical record database of Siriraj Hospital in 2005-2006.
      RESULTS: Ninety- nine patients fit in to the inclusion criteria. All were non
      HIV-infected. There were 44 males (44.4%) and 55 females (55.6%) with a
      male/female ratio of 8:10. The mean and median age was 50.9 +/- 19.8 and 50
      years, respectively, with a range from 1-85 years. The most frequent chief
      complaint was pain (84.8%), followed by functional disability/neurological
      deficit (47.5%), constitutional symptoms (38.4%), fever (24.2%), localized
      swelling (21.2%), fistulas and drainage (11.1%) and discovery as a co-morbid
      disease (1%). The most frequent clinical manifestation was tuberculous
      spondylodiscitis (66.7%) followed by tuberculous septic arthritis (28.3%),
      tuberculous osteomyelitis (10.1%), tuberculous tenosynovitis (4.0%), tuberculous 
      bursitis (2.0%) and tuberculous pyomyositis (2.0%). Concurrent pulmonary TB was
      30.3%. The mean and median time to diagnosis was 20.4 +/- 16.9 and 13 weeks,
      respectively, with a range from 4 days to 104 weeks. The shortest duration of
      time to diagnosis was 0-4 weeks (19.2%) followed by 12-16 weeks (14.1%) and 20-24
      weeks (13.1%). The longest duration of time to diagnosis was 104 weeks (1%). The 
      diagnosis from histopathology was 46.5%, positive AFB 40.4%, positive PCR 33.3%
      and positive culture 19.2%. The radiological abnormalities were osteolytic lesion
      (79.8%), narrowing intervertebral disc space/joint space (54.5%), cold abscess
      (49.5%) and vertebral collapse (43.4%). Surgery with medical treatment was
      performed on 72.7% while the percentage of those receiving medical treatment only
      was 27.3%. The results of treatment were improvement with residual
      deformities/dysfunction occurring in 97%. Death occurred in 3%. CONCLUSION:
      Osteoarticular tuberculosis is common in all age groups. Tuberculous
      spondylodiscitis was the most frequent clinical manifestation in Siriraj
      Hospital, Thailand. Although the patients were provided with adequate medical and
      surgical therapy, osteoarticular tuberculosis was still associated with mortality
      and morbidity.

TI  - A pyogenic discitis at c3-c4 with associated ventral epidural abscess involving
      c1-c4 after intradiscal oxygen-ozone chemonucleolysis: a case report.
PG  - E298-304
LID - 10.1097/BRS.0b013e318195a87e [doi]
AB  - STUDY DESIGN: A case report and clinical discussion. OBJECTIVE: To describe an
      unique case of purulent discitis at C3-C4 and an anterior C1-C4 epidural abscess 
      secondary to oxygen-ozone therapy for the herniated cervical discs. SUMMARY OF
      BACKGROUND DATA: Previously reported complications secondary to ozone therapy are
      rarely documented. No cases of pyogenic discitis with associated epidural abscess
      after oxygen-ozone therapy have been reported to date. To our knowledge, this is 
      the first such case reported in literature. METHODS: A 57-year-old female patient
      with nuchal stiffness was previously treated with ozone therapy at the discs of
      C3-C4, C4-C5, and C6-C7. Five days later, she presented with an attack of neck
      pain and fever followed by progressive quadriplegia with sudden onset of dyspnea 
      and was referred to our hospital. On admission, physical examination revealed a
      temperature of 38.8 degrees C, evident neck tenderness, marked global weakness
      (grade 1-2/5 MRC) in bilateral upper-limb, and a modest global weakness in
      bilateral lower-limb (grade 4/5 MRC). Laboratory findings showed a significantly 
      elevated WCC, ESR, and CRP. Blood culture was negative. Enhanced-MR imaging
      demonstrated a purulent discitis at C3-C4 and a ventral C1-C4 epidural abscess
      with homogenous enhancement indicative of a solid phlegmonous granulation tissue.
      RESULTS: We formulated a 3-stage treatment involving C1-C4 multilevel
      decompressive laminectomies, subtotal unilateral C3-C4 facetectomies, and tissue 
      sampling for culture with application of a corset after surgery, followed by a
      delayed secondary posterior thorough drainage of epidural liquid pus using a
      suction-irrigation drainage, after the abscess had turned to a necrotic liquid
      abscess, on the basis of findings of enhanced-MR imaging, by 10-day duration of
      intravenously antibiotic therapy tailored to Streptococcus bovis isolated from
      infected tissue. Over the next few weeks, the patient made an excellent
      neurologic recovery. However, she did not consent to undergo further
      occipitocervical fusion until the follow-up MR imaging at 8 months demonstrated
      postlaminectomy kyphosis. After surgery, the patient remained clinically
      satisfactory in neurology without evidence of a recurrence of spinal infection. A
      slight improvement in the cervical spine curve was demonstrated in the follow-up 
      radiograph at nearly 4-month postoccipitocervical fusion. CONCLUSION: This case
      report illustrates a rare but life-threatening complication of oxygen-ozone
      therapy for the cervical disc herniation. Infection is a common risk for any
      invasive spinal techniques involving puncture, so attention should be paid to the
      sterility during the procedures. A high index of suspicion along with reliance on
      enhanced-MRI is essential to diagnose the condition and institute appropriate
      treatment on an individual basis.

AB  - Skeletal system involvement is a relatively common complication of human
      brucellosis. However, muscular involvement and psoas abscess are less frequently 
      seen. Psoas abscess is usually secondary to spondylitis. We report on a
      45-year-old man and a 51-year-old woman with brucellosis complicated with
      spondylitis and psoas abscess. The man was successfully treated with the triple
      antibiotic regimen with percutaneous drainage of abscess. The woman was treated
      using an antibiotic combination.

TI  - [Primary psoas abscess in a young healthy male].
PG  - 3967
AB  - A young male saw his general practitioner because of lower back pain, limpness,
      nightly sweating, subfebrilia, and weight loss. Further diagnostics showed that
      he had a primary psoas abscess. Psoas abscesses are categorized as primary and
      secondary. Primary psoas abscess is a rare disease in Europe and North America.
      It is primarily seen in young men, and the classical symptom-triad is: fever,
      back pain, and limpness. The golden standard diagnostic tool is computed
      tomography, and treatment involves appropriate antibiotics, which can be combined
      with percutaneous drainage.

TI  - [Psoas abscess with hip contracture in a patient with Crohn's disease].
PG  - 188-91
AB  - A psoas abscess (PA) is a rare clinical entity but is potentially serious
      condition which presents diagnostic and therapeutic challenges. The diagnosis is 
      frequently delayed due to its variable and nonspecific features and occult
      clinical course. The delay in diagnosis and treatment of PA is the major poor
      prognostic factor. We describe herein a case of the sterile psoas abscess
      complicating Cronh's disease which presented as hip flexion contracture. A
      29-year-old man, at remission stage of CD involving ileocolic segment, was
      admitted due to pain from hip contracture. He had no bloody diarrhea and no
      abdominal pain. PA was confirmed by abdominal ultrasound. PA with hip contracture
      was completely treated with surgical excision, irrigation, drainage, and
      antibiotics. PA was sterile and there was no evidence of a fistulous
      communication from the bowel. Once suspected, aggressive diagnostic work up and
      definitive operative intervention is needed.

TI  - Vertebral osteomyelitis: a potentially catastrophic outcome after lumbar epidural
      steroid injection.
PG  - 693-7
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Epidural steroid injections are commonly used to
      palliate the symptoms of spinal stenosis. Deep tissue infection is a known
      potential complication of these injections. There have been no previous published
      cases of osteomyelitis without epidural abscess after such injections. We present
      a case in an elderly patient who presented only with persistent axial low back
      pain following a lumbar epidural steroid injection (LESI). We emphasize early
      patient evaluation, consideration of infectious predisposing factors, sterile
      technique, and skin disinfectant. DESIGN: Open-label case report. CASE
      DESCRIPTION: A 77-year-old diabetic male with a history of radicular pain related
      to lumbar spinal stenosis was treated successfully several years prior with a
      series of lumbar epidural steroid injections (LESI) and was re-treated with LESIs
      for recurrent symptoms. Following his second epidural injection, he presented
      with back pain and induration at the injection site without fever or neurological
      deficits. Urgent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a soft tissue abscess 
      extending close to the epidural space around the corresponding L4/L5 vertebral
      level. The patient recovered after incision and drainage of the abscess which was
      associated with an osteomyelitis of the L4 and L5 vertebral spine. The causative 
      organism was methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus Aureus. CONCLUSION: This case
      demonstrates that even with proper aseptic techniques, immune-compromised
      patients who are colonized with an aggressive micro-organism may develop a
      potentially catastrophic infectious complication if subtle persistent symptomatic
      complaints are not promptly and carefully evaluated.

PG  - 89-93

AB  - OBJECTIVE: In order to describe the case of an adolescent who developed psoas
      abscesses caused by Paracoccidiodes brasiliensis. DESCRIPTION: A 12-year-old boy 
      was admitted with a history of daily fever and global lymph nodes enlargement. He
      had been treated in the last 6 years, with irregular use of the drugs, for an
      acute form of paracoccidioidomycosis (PCM). He presented a tenderness fluctuating
      polyadenopathy in all cervical, submandibular, supraclavicular, axillary, and
      inguinal chains; several lymph nodes were up to 4 cm in diameter, hardened and
      coalescent. After 1 month of unsuccessful therapy with SMX-TMP, the patient
      presented a pain in the right groin and difficulty to walk. CT scan showed a
      global retroperitoneal lymph nodes enlargement, some with central necrosis and
      two bigger collections adjacent to both psoas muscles. A surgical drainage of the
      collections was performed for several times. The patient received a total of 1.9 
      g of Amphotericin B. After 1 month of the last surgical procedure, CT scan showed
      only a residual collection, and the patient was sent to ambulatory follow-up. We 
      hypothesed that the retroperitoneal lymph nodes became a coalescent mass that
      fistulized to the psoas compartment. COMMENTS: The patient presented a febrile
      lymphoproliferative syndrome that is frequently seen in children with PCM.
      Although a polymorphic manifestation is observed in this disease, psoas abscess
      is a rare complication of PCM. The health professionals that take care of the
      patients with PCM must pay attention to the possibility of this one more
      complication.

TI  - Primary psoas abscess in a patient affected by acquired immunodeficiency
      syndrome: a rare case according to the reviewed literature.
PG  - 261-3
AB  - Abscesses of the psoas muscle can be divided into primary and secondary. In the
      primary ones, it is not possible to identify any further infected site. The
      localization to this muscle is due to its rich vascularization and Staphylococcus
      aureus is the most frequent aetiological agent of the infection. Treatment
      requires the use of appropriate antibiotics, as well as surgical or percutaneous 
      drainage of the abscess. The percutaneous drainage is much less invasive and a
      low risk in the patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, and is
      effective for draining even multiloculated abscess. The authors present a rare
      case of primary psoas abscess in patient affected by acquired human
      immunodeficiency syndrome, showing a mass in the inferior lumbar region through
      the lumbar triangle of Petit and fever. Treatment consisting in percutaneous
      drainage combined with systemic antibiotic administration was successful.

PG  - 960-6
LID - 10.1097/PHM.0b013e3181837724 [doi]
AB  - Spine infections are infrequent but important sources of back pain, posing
      significant risk of neurological sequelae. Risk factors include diabetes, recent 
      trauma or instrumentation, and infection. Pathogens include Staphylococcus aureus
      and beta-hemolytic Streptococcus. A 67-yr-old man presented with lower back and
      hip pain of 2-mo duration without fever. Initial treatment and work-up revealed
      diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis. The patient did not improve with
      conservative care, and neurologic decline was recognized. Magnetic resonance
      imaging identified osteomyelitis, discitis, and epidural abscesses at the L4-L5
      levels. Escherichia coli was identified, and antibiotic treatment with CT-guided 
      drainage precluded the need for surgery. Spine infections and iliopsoas abscesses
      are conditions that can result in serious disability. Awareness of unusual
      diagnoses and atypical pain presentations in patients with chronic spine
      pathology, such as diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis syndrome, is
      important to recognize early to minimize neurological sequelae.

      During this period of illness the child had marked loss of appetite and
      progressive weight loss. There was history of contact with sputum smear positive 
      father. A gibbus was present at thoraco-lumbar region with a cold abscess at the 
      right side of the gibbus and signs of upper motor neuron lesion were found on
      lower limb examination. Diagnosis was supported by relevant investigations
      including MRI of dorsolumbar spine and treatment was started beforehand with
      anti-tubercular drugs. The paravertebral abscess was drained several times and
      antibiotics were used depending upon the results of microbiological study. At the
      same time the patient was advised to wear a modified chest brace for
      immobilization and the management for severe malnutrition was also started
      accordingly. There was significant clinical improvement observed within one month
      of starting treatment.

TI  - [Progressive, ascending neurological impairment: a spinal epidural abscess that
      presents as Guillain-Barre syndrome].
PG  - 1436-9
AB  - Over the course of 4 days, a 65-year-old man developed fever and thoracic back
      pain, followed by weakness and sensory changes in both legs. Physical examination
      revealed dyspnoea, subfebrile temperature, neck pain withoutnuchal rigidity,
      sensory impairment, areflexia and weakness in both legs (and arms to a lesser
      extent). Guillain-Barre syndrome was considered, and treatment with intravenous
      immunoglobulins was started. The patient nevertheless developed respiratory
      insufficiency, progressive leg paresis and nuchal rigidity. Spinal MRI revealed
      an extensive cervicothoracic epidural abscess. Surgical decompression and
      drainage were performed, followed by antibiotic treatment; the patient recovered 
      and was able to walk with assistance. A spinal epidural abscess can be difficult 
      to recognise and is potentially lethal. The diagnosis should be considered in
      patients with fever and back pain, especially when these coincide with symptoms
      of neurological impairment. The efficacy of therapy depends on timely
      recognition; to this end, neuroimaging with MRI is essential.

AB  - Psoas abscess is rarely encountered in obstetric practice. This condition may be 
      primary or secondary resulting from extension of an infectious process near the
      psoas muscle. We report a series of three patients with psoas abscess that were
      encountered in our obstetric practice. Two of these patients had a primary and
      one a secondary abscess. Two patients underwent laparotomy and drainage of
      abscess while one received medical treatment. All patients recovered
      uneventfully.

      osteomyelitis in the MRSA ERA.
PG  - 128-31
LID - 10.1016/j.jinf.2008.04.012 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Hematogenous vertebral osteomyelitis is caused predominantly by
      Staphylococcus aureus. The rise in incidence of methicillin-resistant S. aureus
      (MRSA) has complicated the treatment of this infection. Our objective was to
      evaluate therapeutic outcomes for S. aureus vertebral osteomyelitis in a setting 
      of high MRSA prevalence. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective chart review of
      all patients who presented with S. aureus vertebral osteomyelitis over a 7-year
      period at 2 tertiary care hospitals in Houston, TX, USA. RESULTS: Thirty-five
      patients were identified who received > or =2-week course of parenteral
      antibiotics and had a follow-up period of at least 12 months post-therapy. MRSA
      was responsible for 20 (57%) cases. Mean duration of total antibiotic therapy was
      61.4 days. The overall relapse rate was 14%. At 12 months post-therapy, 86%
      patients were cured. The one factor significantly associated with relapse was
      presence of undrained abscesses (p=0.04). CONCLUSIONS: When the mean duration of 
      effective antibiotic therapy was 60 days, cure rates for S. aureus vertebral
      osteomyelitis exceeded 80%. Drainage of all associated abscesses correlated with 
      a significantly higher rate of cure.

TI  - Psoas abscess rarely requires surgical intervention.
PG  - 223-7
LID - 10.1016/j.amjsurg.2007.07.032 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Surgeons are increasingly encountering psoas abscesses. METHODS: We
      performed a review of 41 adults diagnosed and treated for psoas abscess at a
      county hospital. Treatment modalities and outcomes were evaluated to develop a
      contemporary algorithm. RESULTS: Eighteen patients had a primary psoas abscess,
      and 23 had a secondary psoas abscess. Patient characteristics were similar in
      both groups. Intravenous drug abuse was the leading cause of primary abscesses.
      Secondary abscesses developed most commonly after abdominal surgery. Treatment
      was via open drainage (3%), computed tomography-guided percutaneous drainage
      (63%), or antibiotics alone (34%). Four recurrences occurred in the percutaneous 
      group. Statistical analysis showed that the median size of psoas abscesses in the
      percutaneous group was significantly larger than in the antibiotics group (6 vs 2
      cm; P < .001). The mortality rate was 3%. CONCLUSIONS: Initial management of
      psoas abscesses should be nonsurgical (90% success). Small abscesses may be
      treated with antibiotics alone, and surgery can be reserved for occasional
      complicated recurrences.

TI  - [Psoas abscess in Cote d'Ivoire: a report of eighteen cases].
PG  - 234-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: Psoas abscess is a rarely encountered entity with a non specific
      clinical presentation resulting in delayed diagnosis and treatment. No published 
      data exist on this disease in our country. OBJECTIVE: To describe the diagnostic 
      and therapeutic features of psoas abscesses in Cote d'Ivoire. Methodes: A
      retrospective study of 18 psoas abscesses seen over seven years in two teaching
      hospitals. RESULTS: There were 10 women and eight men with a mean age of 35.7
      years (range:16-62 years). The abscess was primary in 15 cases, secondary in
      three, right sided in 15 and left sided in three cases. Fever, abdominal pain,
      difficulties in walk, abdominal mass and psoitis were the main clinical signs.
      Ultrasonography allowed the diagnosis of psoas abscess in 14 cases and in the
      remaining 4 cases the diagnosis was done peroperatively. The germs were
      identified in 12 patients and were: Escherichia coli in 3 cases, Staphylococcus
      aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Klebsiella pneumoniae
      in two cases each and Mycobacterium tuberculosis in one case. Patients were given
      antibiotics together with surgical drainage of the abscess (n=16) or percutaneous
      needle aspiration (n=2). Postoperative complications included parietal
      suppurations (n=5) and intraperitoneal abscesses (n=2). No death occurred.
      CONCLUSION: For psoas abscess in our practice, ultrasonography is a useful
      diagnostic tool and surgical drainage remains an effective therapeutic method.

TI  - Treatment strategies and outcome in patients with non-tuberculous spinal epidural
      abscess--a review of 46 cases.
PG  - 36-42
LID - 10.1055/s-2007-1004547 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Spinal epidural abscess (SEA) is a rare disease and its early
      detection and appropriate treatment is essential to prevent high morbidity and
      mortality. There are only few single-institution series who report their
      experiences with the microsurgical management of SEA and treatment strategies are
      discussed controversially. Within the last 15 years the authors have treated 46
      patients with SEA. This comparatively high number of cases encouraged us to
      review our experiences with SEA focussing on the clinical presentation,
      microsurgical management and outcome. METHODS: Clinical charts of 46 cases with a
      spinal epidural abscess treated between 1990 and 2004 were reviewed. There were
      30 men and 16 women, the age ranged between 32 and 86 years (mean: 57 years). The
      clinical mean follow-up was 8.5 months (range: 2-84). The clinical presentation
      and severity of neurological deficits were measured by the Frankel grading system
      on admission and on follow-up visit. RESULTS: The abscess was located in the
      cervical spine in 8, the thoracic spine in 17 and the lumbar spine in 21
      patients. On admission 8 patients were in Frankel grade A, 7 in B, 15 in C, 8 in 
      D and 8 in E. During follow-up 1 patient was in Frankel grade A, 1 in B, 5 in C, 
      13 in D and 24 in E. 37 patients underwent primary microsurgery with abscess
      drainage or removal of chronic granulomatous tissue. The clinical symptoms in 4
      patients worsened shortly after the operation due to a compression fracture of
      the vertebral body (n=2) or progress of the abscess (n=2) making re-operation
      necessary. 9 patients with severe critical illness or without neurological
      deficits had primarily a CT-guided puncture for assessment of the causative
      organism. 3 of them needed additional surgical therapy within the hospital stay
      because of a new neurological deficit. All patients were immobilised and treated 
      with antibiotics for at least 6 weeks. The mortality was 6.5%. As for
      complications we noted septicaemia (n=5), meningitis (n=1) and a transient
      malresorptive hydrocephalus (n=1). CONCLUSION: Early diagnosis, microsurgical
      therapy with appropriate antibiotic therapy and careful observation of patients
      are the keys to successful management of SEA. The goal of surgical treatment is
      to isolate the causative organism and to perform a decompression at the site of
      maximal cord compression in cases of neurological deterioration or severe pain.
      Instrumentation with primary fixation does not seem to be imperative. In cases of
      post-operative worsening, a fracture of additionally infected bony elements has
      to be considered and a stabilisation should be discussed on an individual basis.

AB  - Hip pain in children often poses a diagnostic dilemma. Septic arthritis, Perthes 
      disease, and slipped capital femoral epiphysis are among the most important
      causes. Pyomyositis involving muscles around the hip can present with similar
      features as septic arthritis and are difficult to diagnose because of their
      rarity and indolent presentation. Obturator internus and iliopsoas muscle abscess
      have been most commonly reported, with only 1 such report on isolated obturator
      externus muscle abscess. Routine laboratory investigations are nonspecific, and
      the diagnosis rests on imaging modalities. Magnetic resonance scan is the most
      useful investigation in the diagnosis and can pick up early changes in the
      muscle. Treatment involves appropriate antibiotic therapy with or without
      drainage. Most cases resolve completely. We report here a case of isolated
      obturator externus muscle abscess in an 11-year-old child illustrating the
      similarities with septic arthritis of hip and problems encountered during
      diagnosis and management.

TI  - [Psoas abscess of the adult: study of 38 cases].
PG  - 631-6
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Our aim is to report the clinical aspects, the etiologies, the
      treatment and the evolution of the psoas abscess in the adult. METHODS: Our
      retrospective study concerns 38 cases of psoas abscesses collected in the
      Department of Infectious Diseases of Sfax (Tunisia), over a period of 16 years
      (January 1990 - December 2005). RESULTS: The average age is 44 years (extremes:
      16-76 years). The sex-ratio is 1.4. Six patients were diabetics and one had a
      chronic renal injury at the stage of hemodialysis. The clinical manifestations
      were: a fever (76.4%), an abdomino-pelvic ache (84.2%) and a psoitis (34.2%). All
      patients had a biologic inflammatory syndrome with a hyperleucocytosis in 28
      cases. The abscess was one-sided in 29 cases and bilateral in 9 cases. After
      microbiological study and/or histological study, pathogens were identified in 31 
      patients, they were Staphylococcus aureus (10 cases), Staphylococcus lugdunensis 
      (1 case), Streptococci (3 cases), Escherichia coli (2 cases), Bacteroides
      fragilis (1 case), Actinomyces (2 cases), Brucella (3 cases), Mycobacterium
      tuberculosis (8 cases) and Candida glabrata (1 case). The psoas abscess was
      primary in 10 cases and secondary in 28 cases. All the patients received an
      antibiotherapy or an antifungal therapy adapted to the micro-organism in cause,
      with a drainage of the abscess in 25 cases (surgical in 9 cases and percutaneous 
      in 16 cases). The evolution was favourable in 36 cases. One patient presented
      recurrences and one patient died. CONCLUSION: The psoas abscess of the adult is
      characterized by a polymorphe clinical presentation. Germs in cause are very
      variable.

TI  - Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) mitral valve acute bacterial
      endocarditis (ABE) in a patient with Job's syndrome (hyperimmunoglobulin E
      syndrome) successfully treated with linezolid and high-dose daptomycin.
PG  - 72-5
LID - 10.1016/j.hrtlng.2007.04.003 [doi]
AB  - Job's syndrome (hyperimmunoglobulin E syndrome) is a congenitally acquired
      primary immune deficiency. The primary host defense defect in Job's syndrome is
      impaired phagocytosis. Accordingly, patients with Job's syndrome have
      difficulties eradicating staphylococcal infections. A continuous, high-grade
      Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia with a cardiac valve vegetation is the hallmark 
      of S. aureus acute bacterial endocarditis (ABE). ABE may be caused by
      methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus or methicillin-resistant
      Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). We report a case of Job's syndrome MRSA mitral
      valve ABE. Presumably because of impaired phagocytic function, his MRSA ABE was
      complicated by extensive metastatic septic complications manifested as brain
      abscess, multiple epidural abscesses, and multifocal vertebral osteomyelitis. The
      patient did not respond to 5 days of appropriately dosed linezolid and daptomycin
      and remained bacteremic because abscess drainage was not an option in this case
      and the continuous, high-grade MRSA bacteremia continued despite appropriate
      therapy. High-dose daptomycin (12 mg/kg intravenously every 24 hours) was given, 
      and his MRSA bacteremia was rapidly terminated. Because daptomycin does not cross
      the blood-brain barrier in therapeutic concentrations, linezolid was used to
      treat the brain abscess. The extensiveness of infection in this case is
      remarkable and is probably related to impaired phagocytic function from Job's
      syndrome. High-dose daptomycin therapy rapidly cleared the bacteremia and cured
      the endocarditis and epidural abscesses/vertebral osteomyelitis. The patient was 
      treated with 8 weeks of high-dose daptomycin therapy with no adverse effects. If 
      MRSA and methicillin-sensitive S. aureus bacteremias are unresponsive to usually 
      effective antistaphylococcal agents, and surgical drainage of abscesses and
      removal of infected devices are not clinically possible, then a prolonged, high
      dose of daptomycin is a therapeutic alternative in such situations. To the best
      of our knowledge, this is the first case of MRSA mitral valve ABE complicated by 
      extensive epidural abscesses and vertebral osteomyelitis in a patient with Job's 
      syndrome.

TI  - Retroperitoneal infections by community acquired methicillin resistant
      Staphylococcus aureus.
PG  - 172-6
AB  - PURPOSE: We describe the clinical presentation and response to treatment of
      community acquired, methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus retroperitoneal
      infections. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 13 patients with unusual
      retroperitoneal infections who fulfilled Centers for Disease Control criteria for
      community acquired, methicillin resistant S. aureus were included in this
      multicenter study, which was done from May 2004 to June 2005. Distinctive
      features of these infections were noted and treatment alternatives are proposed. 
      RESULTS: Mean patient age was 32 years and 85% of the patients were male. All 13 
      patients presented with back pain and fever. Infected skin lesions were the
      presumed portals of entry for bacteria in all cases. Mean time between skin
      infection and lumbar pain was 48 days. After lumbar pain was established a
      retroperitoneal abscess was diagnosed at a mean delay of 11 days. An association 
      of foci (kidney, perinephric tissue and psoas) occurred in 85% of cases.
      Perinephric tissue was the most affected site. Of note, all patients presented
      with anemia and low serum prothrombin, and required drainage of the
      retroperitoneal collection. Open drainage was performed in all except 1 patient, 
      in whom percutaneous drainage and antibiotic treatment were sufficient. In 1
      patient nephrectomy was necessary. Specific antibiotics were administered as soon
      as culture results were obtained. Sensitivity was 100% to vancomycin,
      trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, ciprofloxacin and gentamicin. There were no
      deaths. CONCLUSIONS: Three characteristics shared by our patients should be given
      special consideration, including an infected skin lesion as the possible portal
      of entry, anemia plus hypoprothrombinemia and frequent involvement of the
      perinephric region. Treatment with drainage and antibiotic therapy was effective 
      in all cases.

TI  - [Bone and joint tuberculosis concurrent with tuberculosis of other organs].
PG  - 523-9
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To study the characteristics of bone or joint tuberculosis (TB)
      accompanied by TB in other organs (especially the lung), and to study patients'
      and doctors' delay in detecting bone or joint TB. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: A
      retrospective study was conducted on 33 patients with bone or joint TB concurrent
      with TB of other organs, especially the lung, who were admitted to our hospital
      between 1981 and 2005. The patients were divided into the following three groups 
      according to the organ of concurrent TB : (1) miliary TB group (N = 10), (2)
      pulmonary TB group (N = 19), and (3) other TB site group (N = 4). The
      relationship between bone/joint TB and TB of other organs was studied by
      comparing the three groups with respect to the time of appearance of
      musculo-skeletal symptoms or signs such as swelling and pain and that of symptoms
      or signs originating from other organs, such as cough, sputum, miliary pattern on
      chest radiograph and superficial lymph node swelling. RESULTS: The mean age (SD) 
      of patients was 50.5 (18.9) yr, and the male to female ratio was 23 : 10. Among
      33 patients, bone TB (including 18 spinal TB) was detected in 24 patients, joint 
      TB in 14, and abscess in 3 (concurrent lesions in some patients). The mean
      intervals from onset of symptoms to consultation (patients' delay), from
      consultation to diagnosis (doctors' delay) and from symptom onset to diagnosis
      (total delay) were 5.5 (13.9), 3.4 (5.2) and 8.9 (13.9) months, respectively. (1)
      Bone/joint TB concurrent with miliary TB (N = 10) In 8 patients with mean age of 
      61.0 (17.4) yr, musculo-skeletal symptoms/signs preceded respiratory symptoms or 
      appearance of miliary pattern on chest radiograph by 7.8 (7.2) (range; 1-24)
      months. The patients', doctors' and total delays were 0.4 (0.5), 7.3 (7.8), and
      7.7 (7.6) months, respectively. In most cases, bone/joint TB was diagnosed after 
      the onset of miliary pattern on chest radiograph. In one patient with
      simultaneous onset of musculo-skeletal and respiratory symptoms/signs (age 21
      yr), the interval of total delay was 1 month, and in one patient with
      musculoskeletal symptoms which appeared six months later than respiratory
      symptoms (age 28 yr), the interval of total delay was 2 months. (2) Bone/joint TB
      concurrent with active pulmonary TB (N = 19). In this group, the mean age was
      52.2 (17.1) yr, and males were predominant (M/F = 15/4). Active pulmonary TB was 
      diagnosed by positive sputum culture in 13 patients, by positive sputum smear or 
      PCR results in 4 patients, and by the clinical course in 2 patients. Ten patients
      (53%) had a previous TB history. Cavitary lesion was observed in 15 patients, and
      the upper lobes were predominantly involved on chest radiograph in 19 patients,
      indicating that the pulmonary TB was probably post-primary (reactivation) in all 
      patients. In 9 patients with mean age of 49.7 (15.7) yr, musculo-skeletal
      symptoms/signs preceded respiratory symptoms by 14.1 (14.0) (range; 4-48) months.
      The patients', doctors' and total delays were 13.3 (17.8), 3.8 (6.6), and 17.1
      (16.1) months, respectively. On the other hand, in 10 patients with mean age of
      54.5 (18.7) yr, musculo-skeletal symptoms/signs and respiratory symptoms/signs
      appeared simultaneously, and the total delay was 2.7 (1.9) months. Twelve of 19
      patients (63%) had complications such as diabetes mellitus, steroid use, and
      liver diseases. In cases with miliary or pulmonary tuberculosis, the total delay 
      in diagnosis (Y) correlates positively with the time lag from onset of
      musculo-skeletal symptoms to respiratory symptoms/signs (X), and the regression
      line (Y = 0.94X + 2.3, r = 0.98, p < 0.001) was almost linear (Y = X), indicating
      that the diagnosis of bone/joint TB was made just after the diagnosis of miliary 
      or pulmonary TB. (3) Bone/joint TB concurrent with TB of other sites (N = 4) In 2
      female cases (21 and 28 yrs) with cervical lymph node TB, musculo-skeletal
      symptoms/signs and cervical lymph node swelling appeared simultaneously. In a
      54-yr male patient, musculo-skeletal symptoms/signs appeared 5 years after
      appearance of testicular enlargement, and testicular TB was diagnosed by biopsy
      simultaneously. In a 33 year-old male patient, musculo-skeletal symptoms/signs
      appeared 7 months after the drainage of pleural and pericardial effusions (TB was
      not diagnosed initially), and then the diagnosis of bone/joint, pleural, and
      pericardial tuberculosis was made for the first time. CONCLUSIONS: In middle-aged
      or elderly patients with active bone/joint TB, miliary TB is sometimes caused by 
      bacillemia originating from the infected bone/joint lesions. In cases with
      bone/joint TB and concurrent pulmonary TB, bone/joint TB and pulmonary TB are
      probably reactivated independently as a result of decreased systemic
      immunocompetence.

TI  - [Urinary tract infection and neurogenic bladder].
PG  - 448-53
AB  - One of the main complications of spinal cord injury is neurogenic bladder when
      the bladder fails to empty spontaneously. Urinary tract infection is the leading 
      cause of morbidity and the second cause of mortality in these subjects. Patient
      education and personalized medical follow-up must ensure adapted management
      depending on the risk factors and the voiding mode. The risk of urinary tract
      infection can be decreased by perfect neurological control of detrusor activity
      combined with a method of drainage: intermittent self-catheterization. Despite
      these measures, many patients experience recurrent symptomatic urinary tract
      infections. Repeated antibiotic therapy increases the risk of selection of
      multiresistant bacteria without reducing either the incidence or the severity of 
      symptomatic urinary tract infections. Asymptomatic bacteriuria is very frequent
      in patients treated by intermittent catheterization and does not justify
      antibiotic therapy, as antiseptics and urinary alkalinizers or acidifiers have
      been shown to be effective. "Antibiocycle" strategies could have a beneficial
      role by significantly decreasing the number of infections and hospitalizations
      with no major ecological risks, by using molecules that are well tolerated orally
      with a low selection pressure. All febrile urinary tract infections require rapid
      investigation and an urgent urological and infectious diseases opinion (abscess, 
      severe sepsis, resistance). The SPILF-AFU 2002 consensus conference provided
      answers to major questions concerning the definition, treatment and prevention of
      nosocomial urinary tract infection, especially in a context of neurogenic
      bladder.

TI  - Pyogenic intradural abscess: a case report.
PG  - E354-7
AB  - STUDY DESIGN: A case report of pyogenic intradural abscess is described.
      OBJECTIVES: The rarity of the presentation and its successful management are
      discussed. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Intradural abscesses are exceptionally
      rare. METHOD: The abscess was drained by performing a posterior midline lumbar
      durotomy, and intravenous antibiotics were initiated. RESULT: At the 1 year
      follow-up, the patient has made significant neurologic recovery. CONCLUSION:
      Intradural pyogenic abscess secondary to chronic pyogenic spondylodiscitis is a
      rare manifestation. MRI is a vital component in diagnosis, which revealed key
      pathologic features within the dural sac as well as in the vertebral column. An
      emergency decompression and appropriate antibiotic regimen is the solution for a 
      favorable outcome.

TI  - Treatment of Serratia marcescens meningitis with prolonged infusion of meropenem.
PG  - 1077-81
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe the use of and cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) penetration of 
      a prolonged infusion meropenem regimen in a patient with Serratia marcescens
      meningitis. CASE SUMMARY: A 54-year-old female was diagnosed with S. marcescens
      meningitis associated with an epidural abscess 57 days after surgery for a
      herniated spinal disk. Meropenem 2000 mg every 8 hours was administered as a
      prolonged (3 h) infusion for the purpose of optimizing pharmacodynamic exposure. 
      Meropenem concentrations were measured from the patient's blood and CSF (via a
      lumbar drain). The prolonged infusion regimen resulted in concentrations in both 
      serum and CSF above the meropenem minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 0.047
      microg/mL for 100% of the dosing interval. After 6 days of therapy, the patient
      showed no further signs of infection and was subsequently discharged to a
      rehabilitation facility. At follow-up, she had completed a 4 week course of the
      prolonged infused therapy without relapse or adverse events. DISCUSSION:
      Gram-negative infections of the central nervous system result in high morbidity
      and mortality. These infections are often difficult to treat because of poor
      antibiotic penetration coupled with increasing antibiotic resistance. Although
      there are 2 other case reports that describe the use of prolonged infusion of
      meropenem, our patient had a lumbar drain in place, thereby allowing us to
      collect multiple CSF samples and more accurately assess meropenem exposure at the
      site of infection. CSF penetration was 6.4% in this patient, resulting in 100%
      time above the MIC throughout the dosing interval. CONCLUSIONS: In this patient
      with meropenem-susceptible S. marcescens meningitis, the use of a high-dose
      prolonged infusion of meropenem resulted in adequate exposure at the site of
      infection and a successful clinical response.

TI  - Video-assisted thoracoscopic anterior surgery for tuberculous spondylitis.
PG  - 100-7
AB  - In the absence of major deformity, the major goal of surgery in tuberculous
      spondylitis is to achieve adequate cord decompression and debridement of diseased
      tissue. We asked whether video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) could be
      undertaken in active tuberculosis of the spine with instrumentation and achieve
      good healing of the disease with fusion and with adequate decompression of the
      cord to achieve neural recovery. We retrospectively reviewed 23 patients (13 men 
      and 10 women with an average age of 38.2 years) with single-level thoracic spinal
      tuberculosis (T4-T11) treated with VATS. Of the 23 patients, 18 had
      paraparesis/paraplegia. The procedures included: (1) debridement and drainage of 
      prevertebral and paravertebral abscess (n = 4); (2) debridement, decompression,
      and reconstruction with rib graft (n = 8); (3) debridement, decompression,
      anterior vertical titanium mesh cage, and open posterior screw-rod fixation (n = 
      5); and (4) debridement, decompression, and anterior screw-rod fixation (n = 6). 
      Twenty-two of 23 patients achieved fusion and there was no recurrence of the
      disease in any of the patients. No patient had neurological deterioration and 17 
      of the 18 neurologically compromised patients regained ambulatory power. Small
      scars (for surgical portals), early mobilization, and short hospital stays were
      the salient advantages.

AB  - We report the first case of a child with an epidural abscess caused by Bartonella
      henselae. This case is unique in that the diagnosis was confirmed by polymerase
      chain reaction (PCR) of the abscess fluid. A 3-year-old male was admitted with a 
      1-week history of fever and lower back pain. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of 
      the lumbar spine revealed a paraspinal soft tissue abnormality extending from the
      T(12) to the L(4) level, and a computed tomography (CT) scan of the lumbar spine 
      showed osteomyelitis at the T(12) level with soft tissue changes. B. henselae
      serology showed an IgG titer of 1:256 and IgM of <1:16.

TI  - Lymph node paradoxical enlargement during treatment for tuberculous
      spondylodiscitis (Pott's disease).
PG  - 292-5
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Paradoxical reactions during adapted antituberculous treatment are 
      defined as a transient, clinical and/or radiological enlargement of pre-existent 
      lesions or appearance of new ones. OBSERVATION: We report herein the case of a
      62-year-old woman who suffered under treatment of Pott's disease from an
      enlargement of her para-vertebral abscess and disco-vertebral lesions, and a
      tuberculous paradoxical reaction characterized by the development of uni- then
      bilateral cervical lymph nodes. Outcome was favourable after drainage by
      percutaneous punction of the adenopathies and oral short course of
      corticosteroids, and the continuation of combined antituberculous therapy.
      CONCLUSION: Paradoxical reactions under adapted antituberculous treatment must be
      considered only after excluding an inadequate or irregular intake, or absorption 
      of antituberculous drugs. This phenomenon is not rare, and has been reported even
      in ten to 15% of the patients not infected with the human immunodeficiency virus.
      The adjunction of a short course of corticosteroids may be necessary and rapidly 
      efficient to control these reactions, in combination with surgical or
      percutaneous drainage of the enlarged lymph nodes, to avoid unfavourable and/or
      unaesthetic fistulisations.

TI  - Psoas abscess - not as rare as we think?
PG  - 269-74
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Iliopsoas abscess (IPA) is a rare condition with a reported worldwide 
      incidence of 12 new cases per year with primary abscesses now predominating. The 
      presentation is often vague and the diagnosis not considered. METHOD: The medical
      records of 15 consecutive patients presenting to our hospital in a 3-year period 
      with IPA were reviewed. Demographic data, presenting features, predisposing
      factors and the investigations performed were recorded. Abscesses were classified
      as primary or secondary and the treatment provided and eventual outcomes were
      analysed. RESULTS: Fifteen patients (eight males) were included. Nine patients
      were pyrexial on admission, 14 were anaemic and all had raised inflammatory
      markers. Only five patients presented with the classical triad of pain, fever and
      limp. The median time to diagnosis was 3 days with a median hospital stay of 27
      days (range 7-243 days). Fourteen patients were diagnosed by computed tomographic
      scan. Three patients were treated with antibiotics alone whilst 11 received
      percutaneous drainage (PCD) as well. Of these, five had recurrence following
      initial drainage, needing further PCD procedures but none needed open drainage.
      Only one patient underwent open drainage initially. The mortality rate was 20%.
      CONCLUSION: The incidence of IPA is probably under-reported. The vague
      presentation leads to delays in diagnosis and increases morbidity and a high
      index of suspicion is the key to early diagnosis. Percutaneous drainage with
      antibiotics is the first line of treatment although recurrence rate is high. Open
      drainage allows simultaneous treatment of underlying pathology in secondary
      abscesses.

TI  - Primary pyomyositis in children: a retrospective analysis of 11 cases.
PG  - 153-9
AB  - This study was undertaken to review our approach to diagnosis and treatment in a 
      series of 11 patients (mean age 8.2 years) with primary pyomyositis, who had
      neither an underlying disease nor a compromised immune system. Nine of the
      children had positive blood cultures, Staphylococcus aureus (eight) and
      Streptococcus group A (one). The sites of infection were iliopsoas (four),
      obturator (two), hip adductors (two), levator scapula (one), thoracolumbar
      paraspinal (one) and gastrocnemius (one) muscles. Antibiotic treatment was
      initially intravenous, followed by oral administration. Of five patients with
      evidence of abscess formation, three underwent percutaneous drainage, whereas two
      required open surgical drainage. The infection resolved completely without any
      sequela in 10 children. One patient who developed acute compartment syndrome
      showed late signs of osteonecrosis of the tibial shaft segment.

TI  - [Case of tuberculous psoas abscess successfully treated with surgery during
      antituberculosis therapy for miliary tuberculosis].
PG  - 661-5
AB  - A case of tuberculous psoas abscess complicated during antituberculosis therapy
      for miliary tuberculosis and successfully treated with surgery was reported. A
      20-year-old man visited our hospital because of fever lasting for 3 months. Chest
      radiography showed miliary nodules in both lungs and transbronchial lung biopsy
      revealed granuloma. Magnetic resonance imaging of the head showed small lesions
      in the brain. Computed tomography of the abdomen showed an enlarged paraaortic
      lymph node and a nodule in the spleen. Needle biopsy of the lymph node revealed
      necrotic tissue. Mycobacterium tuberculosis was not isolated; however, miliary
      tuberculosis was highly suspected based on clinical and radiographic findings.
      Once antituberculosis therapy was initiated with isoniazid, rifampicin,
      streptomycin, and pyrazinamide, the fever subsided. In spite of improvement of
      general radiographic findings, a new abscess was found in the right psoas major
      muscle after 8 months of therapy by computed tomography. A sample of the abscess 
      showed a positive smear, negative culture, and positive PCR test for M.
      tuberculosis. Although antituberculosis therapy continued for another 6 months,
      the abscess enlarged to 7 cm and new retroperitoneal lymph nodes also appeared.
      Surgical drainage and curettage of the abscess was performed. Intra- and
      post-operative specimens were negative for bacteria, fungi, and M. tuberculosis. 
      The patient was treated with isoniazid, rifampicin, and ethambutol for one year
      postoperatively. The disease disappeared without any evidence of relapse for 2.5 
      years after surgery.

AB  - Psoas abscess and lumbar osteomyelitis due to salmonella infection is very rare, 
      although it is frequently seen all over the world. These two complications have
      severe clinical progress, poor prognosis and high mortality. Here, we report a
      case of salmonellosis presenting with bilateral multiple psoas abscesses and
      lumbar osteomyelitis, which resolved completely following medical treatment and

TI  - Multifocal skeletal tuberculosis involving the lumbar spine and a sacroiliac
      joint: MR imaging findings.
PG  - 139-41
AB  - Sacroiliac joint tuberculosis is rare; its coexistence with vertebral
      tuberculosis is even rarer, with only a few such patients reported in the
      literature. We present magnetic resonance (MR) imaging findings of a patient with
      vertebral and sacroiliac joint tuberculosis, who had paravertebral, iliopsoas,
      and buttock abscesses accompanied by a gluteal pus-draining sinus tract. MR
      imaging is the most sensitive and specific imaging modality for diagnosing
      sacroiliitis at its early stage. Sacroiliac joint tuberculosis can reach advanced
      stages with extensive joint destruction and periarticular abscesses if diagnosis 
      and treatment are delayed. A high index of clinical suspicion is required for an 
      early diagnosis. The addition of a coronal SPIR T2-weighted sequence to the
      routine MR imaging evaluation of patients studied for lumbar disk disease may be 
      useful for recognizing sacroiliac joint pathology at an earlier stage.

      therapy.
PG  - 337-41
AB  - Spinal tuberculous abscesses usually respond to anti-tuberculous drugs. The
      purpose of this study was to evaluate the results of surgical drainage after
      failure of first-line anti-tuberculous drugs. Patients with spinal instability or
      vertebral collapse were excluded from the study. The authors retrospectively
      reviewed 11 patients. The operation was successful in all patients.
      Anterior/posterior spinal fusion or curettage was not performed. Drains were
      removed after two to three days. None of the patients required a second
      operation. Complications, such as spinal instability, vertebral collapse, or
      death did not occur.

AB  - Breast abscess caused by human brucellosis is extremely rare. A 46-year-old woman
      received the diagnosis of brucellosis with positive serologic tests. Two weeks
      after the onset of symptoms, the case was complicated by vertebral (L5-S1)
      abscess which was treated by surgical drainage. One month after the diagnosis of 
      brucellosis, the patient noticed a mass in her left breast. Breast palpation
      revealed a painless, mobile, round mass that was hypoechoic on ultrasound
      imaging. Purulent material was obtained by needle aspiration. Besides treatment
      of the breast abscess by needle aspiration, brucellosis was successfully
      controlled by prolonged antimicrobial treatment.

TI  - Acute iliopsoas and adductor brevis abscesses presenting with proximal leg muscle
      weakness.
PG  - 125-8
AB  - Pyomyositis is a bacterial infection of skeletal muscle. We describe the clinical
      case of a 77-year-old woman affected by gait disturbance, repetitive falls, low
      back pain and left thigh and groin pain, but without symptoms of systemic
      infection. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging of the abdomen and 
      pelvis showed abscesses in the left psoas and adductor brevis muscles.
      Investigations of urogenital tract and gastrointestinal system were normal.
      Systemic antibiotic treatment alone was not efficient, while surgical drainage
      improved the clinical picture. The aetiological organism, isolated from the
      abscess, was Staphylococcus aureus. We suggest that this patient had a primary
      pyomyositis rather than a secondary form. This is the first report of concomitant
      abscesses of psoas and adductor brevis muscles with early neurological
      involvement.

      disease adults.
PG  - 625-7
AB  - The majority of data evaluating Salmonella infections in sickle cell anemia (SCD)
      comes from studies performed in children. We report a SCD adult who presented
      with ceftriaxone-resistant Salmonella bacteremia. After appropriate initial
      therapy, persistent back pain prompted evaluation by magnetic resonance imaging
      of the spine, which revealed osteomyelitis and a psoas abscess. The patient
      responded to percutaneous drainage and antibiotics. This report summarizes some
      of the findings of large SCD studies evaluating Salmonella bacteremia and
      osteomyelitis, focusing on adults. Our case exemplifies the need for antibiotic
      coverage for Salmonella species in adult SCD patients with septicemia. We argue
      that imaging studies looking for osteomyelitis should be done routinely in SCD
      patients with Salmonella bacteremia.

AB  - A 38-year-old diabetic woman presented with a deep venous thrombosis of the right
      calf muscle two weeks after an infection of the pharynx. After one week of
      treatment with warfarin, she was readmitted in septic shock with a massive
      swelling of the leg. The thrombosis had progressed to the right iliac and femoral
      veins, and an abscess of the iliopsoas muscle caused by group A streptococci was 
      detected. The treatment consisted of surgical drainage, intravenous penicillin
      and eventually hip joint exarticulation.

TI  - [Psoas abscesses. An up-dated perspective].
PG  - 313-8
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To analyze the characteristics of abscesses of the psoas muscle and
      assess the differences between pyogenic and tuberculous abscesses. METHODS:
      Retrospective descriptive study of all patients with psoas abscess in our
      hospital over the period 1994 to 2004. RESULTS: Fourteen patients were studied
      (10 males), with a mean age of 42 years. Half of them had had an underlying
      disease. The most frequent clinical manifestations were abdominal pain (64%),
      fever (57%), and back pain (43%). All the abscesses were secondary. In 7 patients
      the origin was gastrointestinal, in 6 osteoarticular, and 1 was related with
      infection of an aortobifemoral bypass. Computed tomography was the diagnostic
      imaging method in all patients. Culture of drainage specimens was positive in 92%
      of patients undergoing this procedure. Causal microorganisms included
      Mycobacterium tuberculosis (5), Streptococcus intermedius (4), Staphylococcus
      aureus (3), Escherichia coli (3) and Bacteroides fragilis (2). Tuberculous
      abscesses originated in spondylitis and the clinical presentation was longer
      prior to diagnosis. Drainage was performed in 12 patients (8 percutaneous and 4
      surgical). Mean duration of antimicrobial therapy was 4 weeks. The infection
      resolved in all patients. CONCLUSIONS: Psoas abscess commonly had a
      gastrointestinal and osteoarticular origin. We underscore the high percentage of 
      tuberculous etiology, which had a more insidious clinical and analytical
      presentation and was usually secondary to spondylitis. Prolonged antimicrobial
      treatment associated with drainage was effective therapy.

TI  - Abdominal pain from a thoracic epidural abscess.
PG  - C8-10
AB  - Spinal epidural abscesses are difficult to diagnose and are associated with high 
      morbidity and mortality. A 61-year-old Chinese woman fell and was admitted 5 days
      later with constant epigastric pain and constipation. Clinical examination was
      initially normal. Five days after admission, she developed urinary retention and 
      mild lower limb weakness, progressing overnight to paraplegia. Clinical
      examination was consistent with a thoracic myelopathy. Neuroimaging showed a
      paracentral fluid collection compressing the thoracic cord at T8 level. Emergent 
      neurosurgical intervention revealed an epidural abscess, which was drained. She
      responded to a 9-week course of antibiotics and recovered fully. Radicular pain
      from thoracic pathology can mimic intraabdominal pathology, and a high index of
      suspicion and prompt surgical intervention are essential to avoid the potentially
      devastating consequences of delayed recognition of epidural abscesses.

PG  - 887-92
AB  - The case of 19-year old men with iatrogenic esophageal wall perforation is
      presented. The patient underwent anterior cervical stabilization using plate and 
      screw for fracture of the C4 and C5 vertebra followed by an abscess of
      prevertebral space with discharging pus and food from the wound. The general
      condition was poor. Symptoms included: pneumonia, pleuritis with effusion,
      septicemia with mediastinitis, fever up to 40 and quadriplegia on neurological
      examination. During surgical procedure the implant loose but was still fixed into
      the esophagus causing a large defect in the posterior wall of the hypopharynx and
      cervical part of esophagus was found. The patient undergone three step surgery
      with wide drainage of prevertebral abscess, removing of osteosynthetic plate
      removal and formation of pedicle flap with sterno-cleido-mastoideus muscule. The 
      finnal fourth procedure with using of pediculed infrahyoid flap gave an excellent
      result. During 160 days hospitalization the pus culture showed growth of the 11
      bacterials species (like Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus,
      Enterococcus faecalis) and 2 species of fungus. He was treated 13 types of
      antybiotics. This special case we present because of live threatening
      complication (mediastinitis) and complicated clinical course as well as because
      of unique technique of the defect closure, i.e. the infrahyoid flap occurred to
      be successful.

TI  - [Paravertebral streptococcal myositis complicated by an epidural abscess in a
      5-year-old girl].
PG  - 273-5
AB  - CASE REPORT: A 5-year-old girl was hospitalised for fever, abdominal and lumbar
      pain, associated with general impairment state and a whitlow. One of the blood
      cultures and CSF grew A beta haemolytic Streptococcus, muscular echography and
      MRI showed paravertebral myositis, which was complicated by an epidural abscess. 
      The outcome was good with medical treatment alone. DISCUSSION: Streptococcal
      myositis is a rare and severe skeletal muscle infection caused by A beta
      haemolytic Streptococcus. It is characterized by a muscle necrosis, without
      abscess formation. It has to be distinguished from pyomyositis, usually caused by
      Staphylococcus aureus, where a muscle abscess occurs, which must be treated by
      surgical drainage and antibiotics. Prognosis of this infection is poorer than
      other muscle infections such as pyomyositis, with a high mortality rate. The
      diagnosis is difficult and often delayed. Practitioners should keep in mind this 
      diagnosis, even if symptoms are non specific, in front of an undetermined
      infectious syndrome associated with pain, and make an echography or nuclear
      magnetic resonance imaging to confirm the diagnosis.

PG  - 704-7
AB  - The Brucellosis is a zoonotic and unfrequent infection but it is endemic in
      Spain. It is a well documented cause of fever of unknown origin with varied and
      nonspecific symptoms. The onset of symptoms of brucellosis may be abrupt or
      insidious, developing over several days to weeks. Virtually any organ system can 
      be involved with brucellosis and localization of the process may cause focal
      symptoms. The most frequent focal presentation is the osteoarthicular. Some times
      it can complicates with para-perivertebral abscess. The unilateral psoas
      abscess(PA) is uncommon and the bilateral afection is exceptional. The
      manifestations of PA usually are insidious, the classic tiad of: feber, lumbar
      pain and functional impotence is rare. For the diagnosis the serology c tests and
      cultures are necesary. The imaging techniques like: Ultrasonography and
      Tomography have improved the diagnosis and treatment of this pathologies'
      complications. The recommended therapy is the use of doxycicline and
      streptomicine. Some times the use of percutaneous drainage or open surgery is
      necessary.

TI  - Case report: spinal epidural abscess from Klebsiella pneumoniae.
PG  - 216-7
AB  - We report a rare case of cervical spinal epidural abscess due to Klebsiella
      pneumoniae. While the most likely pathogen is Staphylococcus aureus, 2.5% of CNS 
      infections have been attributed to Klebsiella pneumoniae. The source of infection
      in this case is suspected to be from cervical vertebra osteomyelitis/discitis
      that expanded to epidural space. Prompt drainage of the abscess by decompression 
      with debridement is the key of management that is shown to decrease morbidity and
      mortality in epidural abscess patients.

TI  - Candida spondylodiscitis and epidural abscess: management with shorter courses of
      anti-fungal therapy in combination with surgical debridement.
PG  - 17-23
AB  - Epidural abscess associated with candidal spondylodiscitis is rarely seen,
      particularly when it involves the cervical and thoracic spine. We report two such
      cases that were successfully managed with early surgical debridement, as well as 
      medical therapy with intravenous amphotericin followed by oral fluconazole. The
      literature related to candidal spinal infection is reviewed, and a rational
      approach to the management of this uncommon condition is proposed. A good outcome
      may generally be expected with early diagnosis as well as appropriate surgical
      and pharmacological treatment. Oral fluconazole appears to be useful in the
      management of candida spondylodiscitis complicated by epidural abscess formation.
      Treatment until a normal ESR is attained is ideal, and this may be as short as 3 
      months when surgical drainage has been adequately performed.

TI  - A paraspinal abscess following spinal anaesthesia for caesarean section and
      patient-controlled epidural analgesia for postoperative pain.
PG  - 252-5
AB  - We present a rare case in which a healthy parturient developed a paraspinal
      abscess after spinal anaesthesia for caesarean section and epidural analgesia for
      postoperative pain management. The catheter was in situ for 58 h. Backache was
      the initial and major symptom. A concealed course with no neurological deficit
      resulted in a delayed diagnosis and treatment in this case. The infection was not
      diagnosed until 20 days after the removal of the epidural catheter when there was
      a purulent discharge from the epidural puncture site. Surgical drainage was
      required. Anaesthesiologists should be aware that serious epidural
      analgesia-related infections can happen in extra spinal-epidural spaces.
      Vigilance for these infections, especially in postpartum patients with backache, 
      is needed.

TI  - Primary psoas muscle abscess diagnosed and treated during pregnancy: case report 
      and literature review.
PG  - 147-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: Primary psoas muscle abscess is rare and can be difficult to
      diagnose, particularly during pregnancy. CASE: To our knowledge, this is the
      first case of primary psoas muscle abscess diagnosed during pregnancy. Clinical
      investigation did not reveal any infection spreading from adjacent structures.
      Surgical drainage and simultaneous Cesarean delivery of the infant, combined with
      appropriate antibiotics, enabled a cure. CONCLUSION: The possibility of psoas
      muscle abscess should be taken into account when investigating lower back pain
      during pregnancy if conventional approaches are unsatisfactory.

PG  - 1169-72
AB  - Pott's puffy tumor is an infrequent entity characterized by subperiosteal abscess
      associated with frontal bone osteomyelitis. It is usually seen as a complication 
      of frontal sinusitis. Although cases, in patients of all ages have been reported,
      teenagers are the most frequently affected. Despite modern methods of diagnosis
      and treatment, 9 new cases in children, have been published in the last 7 years. 
      This paper describes the case of 13-year-old boy with subperiosteal abscess
      resulting from exacerbation of chronic frontal sinusitis. Complete resolution
      occurred with an intensive antibiotic regime and drainage of frontal sinus and
      subperiosteal abscess.

      despite the lack of evidence for their efficacy. Here, we report a case in which 
      repeated paravertebral injections of local anesthetics, corticosteroids and
      botulinum toxin resulted in extensive abscess formation involving the entire
      paravertebral musculature descending to the level of the midthighs. These
      abscesses induced a systemic inflammatory response syndrome and required surgical
      drainage as well as broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy.

TI  - Penetration of isoniazid, rifampicin and pyrazinamide in tuberculous pleural
      effusion and psoas abscess.
PG  - 1368-72
AB  - SETTING: Tuberculosis Centre, University Medical Centre, Groningen, The
      Netherlands. OBJECTIVES: To study intralesional concentrations of isoniazid
      (INH), rifampicin (RMP) and pyrazinamide (PZA) in tuberculous pleural effusions
      and psoas abscesses, and to compare these to reference serum values and minimal
      inhibitory concentration (MIC). DESIGN: Intralesional concentrations were
      measured 2 h after drug administration (six pleural effusions, 10 psoas
      abscesses). RESULTS: A wide range of concentrations was found for pleural
      effusions and psoas abscesses. Concentrations were below MIC values in none of 15
      patients for INH, in two of 13 for RMP, and in eight of nine for PZA. The
      Cmax:MIC ratio was always >4 for INH, in four of 13 for RMP, and in none of nine 
      for PZA. In 5/8 patients receiving all three drugs, both RMP and PZA had Cmax:MIC
      ratios <4, indicating sub-therapeutic drug levels. CONCLUSION: Penetration of INH
      was always sufficient, penetration of RMP mostly below the desired ratio, and for
      PZA on average 10 times too low. Five of eight patients on all three drugs had
      Cmax:MIC ratios <4. This indicates intralesional sub-therapeutic drug levels for 
      RMP and PZA, and local monotherapy with INH. This could induce drug resistance.
      Drainage as additional therapy seems indicated.

TI  - Brain abscess secondary to the middle ear cholesteatoma: a report of two cases.
PG  - 433-7
AB  - We experienced two cases of brain abscess secondary to middle ear cholesteatoma. 
      One, a 61-year-old woman, presented with left otalgia, appetite loss and nausea. 
      The computed tomography obtained on admission revealed a middle ear
      cholesteatoma. The magnetic resonance image showed the presence of a brain
      abscess in the cerebellum. The brain abscess was drained and the cholesteatoma
      was removed using the canal down procedure under general anesthesia. Part of the 
      cholesteatoma invaded the posterior cranial fossa was could not be removed from
      the otological surgical field. The patient has been under observation as an
      outpatient for 6 months already and no abnormal signs have been detected. The
      other patient, a 55-year-old man, was admitted to our hospital for a detailed
      examination because he had right otalgia and progressive headache. The
      examination of spinal fluid obtained by lumbar puncture showed marked elevation
      of the white blood cells count. Computed tomography revealed a middle ear
      cholesteatoma. The magnetic resonance image obtained on admission showed an area 
      of low-intensity encapsulated by an area of high-intensity in the right temporal 
      lobe. The abscess was drained and the cholesteatoma was removed using the canal
      down procedure under general anesthesia. The patient has been under observation
      for 1 year already and has presented no signs of recurrence.

TI  - The transpedicular approach in the management of thoracic spine tuberculosis: a
      short-term follow up study.
PG  - E363-7
AB  - STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective descriptive assessment of the clinical and
      radiologic outcomes of 11 patients who underwent transpedicular decompression for
      thoracic spine tuberculosis. OBJECTIVES: To study the neurologic and radiologic
      outcomes in patients who underwent transpedicular decompression for thoracic
      spine tuberculosis. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Several approaches have been used
      in the management of thoracic spine tuberculosis to achieve the goals of
      decompression of the cord followed by immobilization and antituberculous therapy.
      These range from conservative regimens of computed tomography-guided biopsy
      followed by bed rest and drug therapy to radical surgeries that involve extensive
      debridement of the vertebral body followed by instrumentation. The authors report
      their experience with a "middle path" regimen of transpedicular decompression
      followed by external immobilization and antituberculous therapy. METHODS: The
      charts of 11 patients were reviewed retrospectively for clinical outcome, and
      kyphotic angle was measured on the follow-up radiographs to ascertain progression
      of kyphosis. RESULTS: There was no worsening of the neurologic status in any
      patient, and 10 of the 11 patients returned to functional activity. There was no 
      significant progression of kyphosis. CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that the
      transpedicular approach is a viable and safe surgical option for ventral
      decompression in thoracic spine tuberculosis, followed by chemotherapy for 18
      months and immobilization in an alkathene shell for 3 months.

TI  - Retroperitoneoscopic drainage of a psoas abscess.
PG  - e4-5
AB  - Pyogenic psoas abscess in the pediatric age group is a primary condition caused
      mostly by Staphylococcus aureus. The preferred treatment is percutaneous or
      surgical drainage under a cover of systemic antibiotics. Laparoscopic drainage
      scores over open surgery in terms of minimal invasion, shorter hospital stay,
      better patient comfort, and more complete drainage compared with the percutaneous
      approach. The authors report a case of a 4-year-old boy with a psoas abscess that
      was effectively drained laparoscopically through an extraperitoneal approach.

TI  - Is spinal instrumentation a risk factor for late-onset infection in cases of
      distant infection or surgery? Case report.
PG  - E15
AB  - As a cause of revision spinal surgery, spinal epidural abscess after
      instrumentation-assisted fusion is rare in neurosurgical practice. Postoperative 
      infections are frequently seen in the time period soon after surgery. The authors
      report on the case of a 45-year-old woman who had undergone posterior
      instrumentation-augmented fusion for L4-5 degenerative spondylolisthesis. Ten
      months after the operation she presented to the neurosurgery clinic with
      complaints of severe low-back pain and radicular right lower-extremity pain. She 
      had undergone laparoscopic surgery for acute cholecystitis 1 month prior to
      readmission. Radiological study revealed a spinal epidural abscess in
      communication with a right psoas abscess at L4-5. The abscess was drained
      percutaneously with the aid of C-arm fluoroscopic guidance, and a 6-week course
      of parenteral antibiotic therapy was administered. Retrograde lymphatic bacterial
      translocation, hematopoietic spread, and the suitable characteristics in the host
      may facilitate the development of infection around the implant. Thus, distant
      surgery and infection may be a risk factor in cases in which spinal
      instrumentation is placed. In such cases a prolonged antibiotic therapy for
      distant infection after surgery is recommended.

TI  - Extended cervicolumbar spinal epidural abscess associated with paraparesis
      successfully decompressed using a minimally invasive technique.
PG  - E300-3
AB  - STUDY DESIGN: A case of a multisegmental, cervicothoracolumbar epidural abscess, 
      in an 80-year-old man, successfully decompressed by using a minimally invasive
      technique, is presented. OBJECTIVE: To review risk factors, diagnosis, treatment,
      decompression techniques, and morbidity and mortality regarding spinal epidural
      abscess. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Extended spinal epidural abscess is a rate
      entity. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a multilevel spinal
      epidural abscess, completely decompressed by limited laminectomies in combination
      with the use of a silicon catheter, epidurally. METHODS: The clinical and
      radiographic features associated with spinal epidural abscess, as well as
      decompression technique, are presented. The 80-year-old man, with a one week
      history of urinary tract infection, presented with fever and low back pain, mild 
      weakness in his legs and jaundice. He underwent bilateral limited laminectomies
      at T2-T3 and a right hemilaminectomy at L1-L2 and the pus was drained, under mild
      continuous suction, using a 2.7 mm outer and 1.3 mm inner diameter silicon
      catheter, inserted caudally and cranially into the epidural space, at both the
      laminectomy sites. RESULTS: The patient experienced immediate relief of the low
      back pain, gradual fever subsidence and full neurological recovery during the
      next 3 weeks. CONCLUSION: In cases of suspected acute epidural abscess,
      especially in elderly debilitating patients: the whole spine should be scanned by
      MRI to exclude the possibility of multilevel involvement and adequate pus
      drainage, when indicated, could be performed with the above described minimally
      invasive technique.

TI  - [Pyogenic sacroiliitis complicated by iliopsoas muscle abscess].
PG  - 149-52
AB  - Both pyogenic sacroiliitis and iliopsoas muscle abscess are uncommon infectious
      entities, and their coexinstence has been reported in very few patients. We
      present here the case of a woman who developed a large iliopsoas abscess as a
      consequence of a pyogenic sacroiliitis, initially misdiagnosed as a common
      sciatica and treated with corticosteroids. The patient was cured by the surgical 
      drainage of the abscess and a long-lasting antibiotic treatment. We discuss
      diagnostic difficulties linked to the two infectious entities, their possible
      pathogenic connections, the role of imaging procedures, and therapeutic options. 
      We conclude that pyogenic sacroiliitis and the potential evolution to an
      iliopsoas abscess must be taken into consideration in the differential diagnosis 
      of lower back pain, especially if fever is a concomitant sign.

TI  - Tuberculous osteomyelitis of the lumbosacral region: a spinal epidural abscess
      with presacral extension.
PG  - 346-8
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Tuberculous osteomyelitis in the lumbosacral region is an uncommon 
      occurrence, and its treatment is not well-defined in the literature, particularly
      when it is associated with abscess formation. We present the outcome of a patient
      who had an epidural abscess with presacral extension. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A
      30-year-old man had microbiologically confirmed tuberculous infection of the
      lumbosacral vertebrae complicated by extensive abscess formation. After a trial
      of chemotherapy, the infection proved refractory, and the treatment proceeded
      with abscess drainage through the anterior route. RESULTS: Approximately 1 year
      after surgery, the patient was symptom-free and did not show any significant
      radiologic changes. CONCLUSION: Antituberculous chemotherapy combined with
      anterior surgery seems to be beneficial in the setting of lumbosacral
      osteomyelitis complicated by epidural abscess formation with presacral extension.

TI  - Craniovertebral junction Pott's disease.
PG  - 49-55
AB  - Pott's disease of the craniovertebral junction is extremely rare. The authors
      studied the immediate and long-term outcome after transoral decompression,
      occipitocervical stabilization with fusion and antitubercular therapy (ATT) in
      patients who had neurological deficits due to craniovertebral junction (CVJ)
      tuberculosis. This is a retrospective study of the management and outcome in 10
      consecutive patients in whom features of spinal cord (with or without)
      compression were observed, and CVJ tuberculosis was diagnosed in two different
      neurological departments between 1990 and 2002. They ranged in age from 15 to 72 
      years. The onset of symptoms was either acute or subacute. Patients presented
      with neck and occipital pain (90%), progressive tetraparesia (40%), sensory
      symptoms (40%), neck stiffness (30%) and urinary dysfunction (20%). The disease
      caused spinal cord compression in six patients, atlantoaxial dislocation in five 
      patients, basilar impression in one and upper vertebral column destruction
      without dislocation in three. Two patients presented with multiple spinal
      tuberculosis. Antitubercular therapy was used in all cases for 15 months.
      Surgical treatment performed in all patients. Four patients underwent transoral
      drainage of retropharyngeal abscess with granulation tissue and one
      odontoidectomy. Six patients then underwent occipitocervical (occiput -C3 or -C4)
      fusion with insertion of titanium plate and screw. Postoperatively, ATT was
      prescribed for 15 months. At long-term follow-up (median 50.2 months), functional
      status considerably improved. Two patients died 2 months later due to myocardial 
      infarction. Patients with CVJ with features of cervical myelopathy are ideally
      treated with transoral decompressive procedures followed by occipitocervical
      fusion, because this therapy provides immediate neurological improvement,
      stability and allows early mobilization. The long-term prognosis in patients with
      this disease is excellent, provided it is treated with appropriate surgical
      intervention and with adequate duration of ATT. This approach provides excellent 
      access to this region, with a low operative morbidity and no mortality.

PG  - 234-5
AB  - Malakoplakia is a rare chronic inflammatory disease, usually involving the
      urogenital tract. We report a patient who presented with a psoas abscess, and
      later developed colocutaneous fistula at the site of abscess drainage and
      multiple spontaneous fistulae away from the site of incision. Histology of the
      resected specimen showed Michaelis-Gutmann bodies, which are diagnostic of
      malakoplakia.

TI  - [A case of ventriculitis with bacterial meningitis occurred during the treatment 
      of liver abscess].
PG  - 977-81
AB  - A 47-case-year old male was admitted to our hospital because of high fever and
      general fatigue. He had no immune deficiency, and had no other disease in his
      past history. On admission, the white blood cell count and C-reacted protein were
      severely elevated (18,700/microliter, 27.7 mg/dl, respectively) and abdominal CT 
      revealed multiple low density, From these results, he was diagnosed as liver
      abscess. Intravenous MINO and SBT/CPZ injection were started. On the fifth
      hospital day, he suffered from headache and nuchal rigidity. The clinical data
      revealed the cerebro-spinal fluid (CSF) counting 8,336 cells/mm3 (mononuclear
      8,000,) protein at 119 mg/dl, and sugar 42 mg/dl. CSF cultures were negative, but
      Klebsiella was recognized in the blood culture and drainage fluid in liver
      abscess. This condition was diagnosed as bacterial meningitis and antibiotics
      were changed to intravenous CTRX and MEPM. Furthermore we administered oral PSL
      and intravenous steroid-pulse therapy. After these combination therapies his
      condition improved gradually. After 40 hospital day, however, he suddenly had
      double vision, Axial FLAIR (SE6,000/120) image revealed with high signal
      intensity at 4th ventricle. Intravenous MEPM was administered again. On the 60th 
      hospital day, double vision was gradually improved and abnormal intensity at 4th 
      ventricle was almost disappeared. This case may provide us a considerable
      suggestion on the treatment of bacterial meningitis.

      Epidural and Paravertebral Abscesses. Clinical manifestation of a Job's
      Syndrome?].
PG  - 534-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: The hyper-IgE syndrome is a rare primary immunodeficiency
      characterized by recurrent staphylococcal infections and high levels of serum
      IgE. CASE REPORT: The case of a 28-year-old man with epidural and paravertebral
      abscesses and a markedly elevated serum IgE level of 2,609 U/ml is reported.
      There was no allergic diathesis, nor had the patient a history of other diseases,
      which might explain the high serum IgE level. In a blood culture, Staphylococcus 
      aureus was detected. Since early childhood, the patient has suffered from
      recurrent skin infections. CONCLUSION: The presented study case discusses the
      diagnosis of a Job's syndrome in this patient and reviews previously published
      cases. It also summarizes the current knowledge about pathogenesis and diagnostic
      criteria of this rare syndrome.

TI  - [Serious renal infection: report of three cases].
PG  - 207-11
AB  - In renal infections, lack of peculiar symptoms and consequent delay of diagnosis 
      can sometimes lead to a critical condition of the patient. We report three cases 
      of life-threatening renal infections in female patients, two of which were
      subsequently fata. One patient died of left emphysematous pyelonephritis with
      bilateral pleuritis. The patient was correctly diagnosed 13 days after the onset 
      of symptoms and expired 2 months later despite nephrectomy on the day of
      diagnosis. The second patient died of septic shock 3 days following the onset of 
      symptoms. Autopsy revealed multiple perinephric abscess of the left kidney. The
      non-fatal case was a perinephric abscess spread to the iliopsoas muscle. The
      patient was diagnosed with perinephric abscess 11 days after the onset of
      symptoms and eventually underwent nephrectomy 9 days later. Two of the patients
      were diabetics and the third was a probable diabetic, who died too suddenly to
      confirm the diagnosis. Herein, we review the literature of, and discuss the
      diagnosis and management of serious renal infection.

TI  - Late infection in patients with scoliosis treated with spinal instrumentation.
PG  - 116-23
AB  - Sixty patients were treated using a multilevel spinal instrumentation system.
      Spine arthrodesis was done posteriorly in all patients using a combination of two
      rods, hooks, screws, and cross-link plates. The Galveston technique was used in
      three patients. Five patients presented with late deep wound infections 1 to 5
      years postoperatively. Two patients presented with a local subcutaneous abscess, 
      whereas the remaining patients had a local drainage. Exploration revealed pus
      lining the instrumentation surface, at least one loose cross-link nut, and local 
      hardware corrosion and metal infiltration of the surrounding tissues. All
      patients had a satisfactory bony arthrodesis, so instrumentation was removed.
      Intraoperative cultures revealed three coagulase-negative Staphylococci, one
      Acinetobacter baumani, and one Peptostreptococcus. A continuous irrigation system
      with antibiotics was placed for 5 days in all patients in combination with
      intravenous antibiotics and oral antibiotics. All patients responded to the
      treatment, with no recurrence of the infection after removal of the
      instrumentation. Although the exact nature of these infections requires
      additional investigation, the findings suggest a correlation between
      instrumentation failure and loosening and late infection. Bone involvement was
      not observed and removal of instrumentation was a reliable means of treatment.

TI  - Epidural abscess in a patient with dorsal hyperhidrosis.
PG  - 450-3
AB  - PURPOSE: To report the management of a patient who developed a lumbar epidural
      abscess when an epidural catheter was placed three years after a thoracic
      sympathectomy. The possible contribution of hyperhidrosis is discussed. CLINICAL 
      FEATURES: A 62-yr-old male had compensatory hyperhidrosis in his back after
      thoracic sympathectomy. The patient, who suffered from thromboangeitis
      obliterans, underwent lumbar (L2-3) epidural catheterization in order to improve 
      arterial circulation and ameliorate resting pain in his left leg. On the third
      day after catheterization, the patient complained of a dull pain in his back.
      Emergency magnetic resonance imaging revealed a 12-mm abscess in the epidural
      space. On the tenth day after catheterization, laminotomy at the 3-4 lumbar
      vertebrae and local drainage were performed. A 14-mm abscess was removed from the
      epidural space. The patient was discharged on day 21 after catheterization
      without any disability. CONCLUSION: Special precautions against infection may be 
      necessary in patients with hyperhidrosis in the area where continuous epidural
      catheterization is attempted.

TI  - [Psoas abscess after anterior spinal fusion].
PG  - 252-8
AB  - We present 3 cases of secondary psoas abscess after anterior spinal fusion. Psoas
      abscess is still a rare clinical entity. It is often associated with unspecific
      symptomatology and may present as late infection. A high index of suspicion is
      required for early diagnosis and treatment. Computed tomography is the imaging
      technology of choice. Treatment includes open abscess drainage and antibiotic
      therapy. In secondary psoas abscess causative treatment of the primary infection 
      focus is essential. For psoas abscess after anterior spondylodesis this includes 
      treatment of a deep wound infection. Predisposing factors for postoperative
      infection are large implants, bone grafting, long operating times, previous
      spinal surgery, immunodeficiency and metabolic disorders. Usually several
      operations are necessary to eradicate infection. As long as stability is
      guaranteed, implant materials should be removed. Continuing antibiotic therapy
      for 2-3 weeks after normalization of infectious parameters is suggested. Delayed 
      therapy results in an increase of the morbidity and mortality of psoas abscess.

TI  - Psoas abscess: the spine as a primary source of infection.
PG  - E106-13
AB  - STUDY DESIGN: Case report, literature review, discussion. OBJECTIVES: To
      emphasize the role of the spine as primary source of infection for psoas abscess.
      SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Spine-associated psoas abscesses increase with more
      frequent invasive procedures of the spine and recurring tuberculosis in
      industrialized countries. Diagnosis is often delayed by misinterpretation as
      arthritis, joint infection, or urologic or abdominal disorders. METHODS: We
      present six cases of psoas abscesses associated with spinal infections that were 
      treated in our hospital from January to December 2001. Diagnostic and treatment
      concepts are discussed. RESULTS: Our data emphasize the importance of the spine
      as primary source of infection and suggest an increase in the incidence of
      secondary psoas abscess. Treatment includes open surgical drainage and antibiotic
      therapy. In patients with high operative risk and uniloculated abscess, a
      CT-guided percutaneous abscess drainage can be sufficient. It is essential to
      combine abscess drainage with causative treatment of the primary infectious
      focus. Related to the spine, this includes treatment of spondylodiscitis or
      implant infection after spinal surgery. Usually, several operations are necessary
      to eradicate bone and soft-tissue infection and restore spinal stability.
      Continuous antibiotic therapy over a period of 2-3 weeks after normalization of
      infectious parameters is recommended. CONCLUSION: The spine as primary source of 
      infection for secondary psoas abscess should always be included in differential
      diagnosis. Because the prognosis of psoas abscess can be improved by early
      diagnosis and prompt onset of therapy, it needs to be considered in patients with
      infection and back or hip pain or history of spinal surgery.

TI  - Severe low back pain due to retroperitoneal abscess formation in diabetic
      patients.
PG  - 309-12
AB  - We report two cases of diabetic patients with severe low back pain associated
      with retroperitoneal abscesses. In the first case, multiple retroperitoneal and
      spinal epidural abscesses were detected. Paraplegia due to the spinal epidural
      abscess was not relieved by drainage of the abscess and subsequent antibiotic
      therapy. In the second case, drainage of the retroperitoneal abscess and
      antibiotics were immediately started, resulting in successful recovery. Thus, we 
      suggest that if a diabetic patient complains of low back pain, potential abscess 
      formations should be considered and given appropriate treatment before
      administering epidural anesthetic injections for pain relief.

TI  - Surgical management of abdominal tuberculosis.
PG  - 862-7
AB  - Recent reports suggest an increased incidence of abdominal tuberculosis in the
      United States, particularly in high-risk groups. The aim of this study was to
      review the spectrum of abdominal tuberculosis and its surgical management at a
      tertiary referral center in the United States. The medical records of patients
      treated for abdominal tuberculosis at our institution between January 1992 and
      June 2001 were retrospectively reviewed. Eighteen patients were diagnosed with
      abdominal tuberculosis by microbiologic and/or histologic examination. The 10 men
      and eight women had a mean duration of symptoms of 4 months (range 1 to 24
      months). Five were born in the United States, and 13 were foreign born (7 Asians 
      and 6 Africans). The United States-born patients with abdominal tuberculosis, as 
      compared to the foreign-born patients, were older (mean age 74 years vs. 35
      years), more likely to have chronic medical illnesses (80% vs. 7%), and had
      concomitant pulmonary tuberculosis (60% vs. 0%). Computed tomography was the most
      frequent imaging modality (88%); findings suggestive of abdominal tuberculosis
      were mesenteric/omental stranding (50%), ascites (37%), and retroperitoneal
      lymphadenopathy (31%). Seventeen of the 18 patients required operative
      intervention, and one patient underwent CT-guided drainage of a psoas abscess.
      Laparoscopy was useful for diagnosis in eight patients; laparotomy was performed 
      for complications of abdominal tuberculosis in six patients and to obtain a
      tissue diagnosis in three patients. Abdominal tuberculosis continues to represent
      a diagnostic challenge to clinicians. Among native-born white Americans,
      abdominal tuberculosis is primarily a disseminated disease of elderly,
      debilitated patients with chronic illnesses. Among foreign-born individuals,
      abdominal tuberculosis occurs in young, immunocompetent patients from endemic
      areas. Characteristic CT findings should be evaluated for abdominal tuberculosis 
      in the appropriate clinical setting. Laparoscopy is an effective modality for
      diagnosis of peritoneal tuberculosis.

TI  - [A case of spinal epidural abscess associated with retropharyngeal abscess].
PG  - 1143-6
AB  - Spinal epidural abscesses are known to occur associated with retropharyngeal
      abscess, but such cases are few in the literature. We treated a 72-year-old woman
      who reported pain in the back of the neck. Computed tomography (CT) showed a
      retropharyngeal abscess extending to the upper neck through the carotid space on 
      the left side and an magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a spinal epidural
      abscess without cervical vertebral osteomyelitis. The abscess was assumed to
      reach the epidural space along the nerve root through the intervertebral foramen.
      Since tonsillitis appeared to cause the retropharyngeal abscess, we performed
      tonsillectomy, and then drained pus through the superior constrictor muscle,
      effecting a subsequent cure. Staphylococcus aureus was recovered from both the
      pus and tonsil, and Streptococcus constellatus, a member of the Streptococcus
      milleri group, from the tonsil. Based on a review of the literature, clinical
      courses of spinal epidural abscess associated with retropharyngeal abscess are
      not always simple, as 4 of the 7 cases found demonstrated poor prognosis. Spinal 
      epidural abscess should be considered a critical complication of retropharyngeal 
      abscess.

TI  - Severe Fusobacteria infections (Lemierre syndrome) in two boys.
PG  - 616-8
AB  - UNLABELLED: Abscess formation is a rare cause of febrile illness in childhood but
      always has to be considered in such clinical presentations. Belonging to the
      resident flora of the oropharyngeal region, Fusobacteria are known to cause local
      infections; from here they may extend to other sites via the bloodstream or are
      aspirated into the lung (Lemierre disease). We report on two boys with Lemierre
      disease due to infection by Fusobacteria in monoculture causing two different
      clinical phenotypes. Case 1 presented with a large subphrenic abscess and
      pneumonic infiltration of the right middle lobe. Primary focus of infection was
      periodontal disease. Case 2 presented with a life-threatening septicaemia due to 
      a retropharyngeal abscess and perforated otitis media followed by osteomyelitis
      of the atlas and thrombosis of the left sigmoid sinus and internal jugular vein. 
      CONCLUSION: Fusobacteria should be considered in any abscess formation in
      children. A thorough examination of the oropharyngeal region as a possible site
      of primary manifestation is mandatory.

TI  - Osteomyelitis of the odontoid process associated with meningitis and
      retropharyngeal abscess--case report.
PG  - 447-51
AB  - A 52-year-old man complaining of headache and nuchal pain was treated initially
      under a diagnosis of bacterial meningitis. The meningitis resisted antibiotic
      therapy, and one week later was complicated by a ruptured retropharyngeal
      abscess, which led to the correct diagnosis of osteomyelitis of the odontoid
      process of the axis. His neck was immobilized in a high neck collar and the
      retropharyngeal abscess was treated by repeated drainage and irrigation. A long
      course of antibiotic administration finally resolved the infection. Osteomyelitis
      of the odontoid process is rare and presents with peculiar signs and symptoms.
      Careful consideration of the differential diagnosis is needed for the early
      detection of this potentially serious condition.

AB  - A case of purulent spinal epidural abscess in a 20-day-old girl is presented. The
      patient had symptoms of fever, localized back pain and swelling over the
      interscapular area. The diagnosis was made by magnetic resonance imaging.
      Purulent material grew Staphylococcus aureus from the lesion. Because of severe
      cord compression surgical laminotomy and drainage were performed, and antibiotics
      were administered. One year later she was doing well without neurologic sequelae.

TI  - [[Primary psoas abscess. Presentation of 3 cases].
PG  - 552-5
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To present 3 cases of primary abscess of the psoas muscle. The
      clinical features, diagnostic tests, treatment and outcome are discussed.
      METHODS/RESULTS: Three patients that presented with fever and pain referred to
      the renal and/or iliac fossa are described. Physical examination showed psoas
      involvement in only one patient. Among the complementary tests performed,
      ultrasound demonstrated the abscess in one of the cases; the definitive diagnosis
      was made by contrast-enhanced CT. One of the cases was treated only with
      antibiotics while the other two cases were treated with CT-guided percutaneous
      drainage and appropriate antibiotic therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Psoas abscess is an
      uncommon pathology whose presenting features are usually unspecific. CT with
      contrast enhancement is considered to be the technique of choice for the
      diagnosis and to corroborate the resolution of the condition. Recently, the use
      of CT or US-guided percutaneous drainage has replaced surgery as the initial
      therapeutic approach for this condition.

AB  - Delayed complications associated with sublaminar and interspinous wiring in the
      pediatric cervical spine are rare. The authors present a case of delayed
      complication in which a cervical fusion wire migrated into the cerebellum,
      causing subsequent cerebellar abscess 2 years after posterior cervical
      arthrodesis. A craniotomy was required to remove the wire and drain the abscess. 
      Despite their history of safety and successful fusion, procedures involving
      sublaminar and interspinous wiring carry a risk of neurological injury secondary 
      to wire migration. A thorough neuroimaging evaluation is required in patients who
      have undergone fusion and who have neurological complaints to detect late
      instrumentation-related sequelae.

TI  - Vertebral osteomyelitis: long-term outcome for 253 patients from 7 Cleveland-area
      hospitals.
PG  - 1342-50
AB  - We report a retrospective study of 253 patients with vertebral osteomyelitis (VO)
      who had long-term follow-up. Eleven percent of the patients died, residual
      disability occurred in more than one-third of the survivors, and relapse occurred
      in 14%. Median duration of follow-up was 6.5 years (range, 2 days to 38 years).
      Independent risk factors for adverse outcome (death or qualified recovery) were
      neurologic compromise, time to diagnosis, and hospital acquisition of infection
      (P< or =.004). Surgical treatment resulted in recovery or improvement in 86 (79%)
      of 109 patients. Magnetic resonance images (110 patients) were often obtained
      late in the course of infection and did not significantly affect outcome. Often, 
      relapse developed in individuals with severe vertebral destruction and abscesses,
      appearing some time after surgical drainage or debridement. Recurrent bacteremia,
      paravertebral abscesses, and chronically draining sinuses were independently
      associated with relapse (P< or =.001). An optimal outcome of VO requires
      heightened awareness, early diagnosis, prompt identification of pathogens,
      reversal of complications, and prolonged antimicrobial therapy.
