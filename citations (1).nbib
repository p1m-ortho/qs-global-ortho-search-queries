TI  - Cyclic neutropenia and pyomyositis: a rare cause of overwhelming sepsis.
PG  - 26-8
AB  - Primary pyomyositis is a pyogenic infection of skeletal muscle with abscess
      formation, which traditionally lacks an identifiable cause. We present a case of 
      pyomyositis for which a cause was established. This was largely due to the fact
      that the patient was young and fit, enabling him to survive such overwhelming
      sepsis long enough for cycling of his neutrophil count to become apparent. Having
      had multiple abscesses drained, he was successfully treated with granulocyte
      colony stimulating factor and has remained well since.

TI  - Occult maxillary sinusitis as a cause of fever in tetraplegia: 2 case reports.
PG  - 430-2
AB  - Common causes of fever in tetraplegia include urinary tract infection,
      respiratory complications, bacteremia, impaired autoregulation, deep vein
      thrombosis, osteomyelitis, drug fever, and intra-abdominal abscess. We report 2
      acute tetraplegic patients who presented with fever of unknown origin. After
      extensive work-up, they were diagnosed with occult maxillary sinusitis. A search 
      of current literature revealed no reports of sinusitis as a potential source of
      fever in recently spinal cord--injured patients. Patients with tetraplegia,
      especially in the acute phase of spinal cord injury, often undergo nasotracheal
      intubation or nasogastric tube placement, which may result in mucosal irritation 
      and nasal congestion. All of the previously mentioned factors, in combination
      with poor sinus drainage related to supine position, predispose them to
      developing maxillary sinusitis. The 2 consecutive cases show the importance of
      occult sinusitis in the differential diagnosis of fever in patients with
      tetraplegia.

TI  - Fatal Aspergillus fumigatus Myositis in an immunocompetent patient.
PG  - 810-3
AB  - A 69-year old farmer developed Aspergillus myositis in the right psoas and
      paravertebral muscles extending to the retroperitoneum and the fifth lumbar
      vertebra. The infection appeared after two local instillations of steroid for
      back pain. Although the patient was not immunocompromised, surgical drainage and 
      antifungal therapy failed to cure him; he died of a bacterial pulmonary
      superinfection while cultures of the abscess drainage fluid grew Aspergillus. The
      likely portal of entry in this patient was direct inoculation during infiltration
      of the steroid; the steroid probably caused a local impairment in host defenses. 
      Only six cases of Aspergillus myositis have been reported previously. All of them
      occurred in severely immunosuppressed patients and the outcome was fatal in all
      cases.

TI  - Tuberculous aneurysm of the abdominal aorta: endovascular repair using stent
      grafts in two cases.
PG  - 215-8
AB  - Tuberculous aneurysm of the aorta is exceedingly rare. To date, the standard
      therapy for mycotic aneurysm of the abdominal aorta has been surgery involving
      in-situ graft placement or extra-anatomic bypass surgery followed by effective
      anti-tuberculous medication. Only recently has the use of a stent graft in the
      treatment of tuberculous aortic aneurysm been described in the literature. We
      report two cases in which a tuberculous aneurysm of the abdominal aorta was
      successfully repaired using endovascular stent grafts. One case involved is a
      42-year-old woman with a large suprarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm and a right
      psoas abscess, and the other, a 41-year-old man in whom an abdominal aortic
      aneurysm ruptured during surgical drainage of a psoas abscess.

TI  - Halo pin intracranial penetration and epidural abscess in a patient with a
      previous cranioplasty: case report and review of the literature.
PG  - E463-7
AB  - STUDY DESIGN: Report of a patient with an epidural abscess after halo pin
      intracranial penetration at the site of a previous cranioplasty. OBJECTIVES: To
      report a rare case of intracranial penetration at the site of a previous
      cranioplasty associated with epidural abscess, and to discuss the diagnostic and 
      therapeutic approach to its management. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: The most
      serious complications associated with use of halo device occur when pins
      penetrate the inner table of the skull, resulting in cerebrospinal fluid leak and
      rarely in an intracranial abscess. However, no mention of intracranial halo pin
      penetration at the site of a previous cranioplasty was found in the literature.
      METHODS: A 64-year-old man with ankylosing spondylitis had a halo vest placed for
      management of a fracture dislocation through the C5-C6 intervertebral disc space 
      associated with left C6 radiculopathy. One week later, the patient experienced
      fever and headache associated with pain, redness, and drainage at the site of the
      insertion of the left posterior pin. Computed tomography of the brain showed a
      1.5-cm intracranial penetration of the halo pin through a previous cranioplasty
      of the temporal bone, associated with epidural abscess and cerebral edema in the 
      left temporoparietal lobe. The pins and the halo vest were removed, the pin site 
      was cleaned, and a Philadelphia cervical collar was applied. Staphylococcus
      epidermidis grew on the culture of drainage from the pin site. The patient
      started immediate intravenous antibiotic treatment for 2 weeks, followed by oral 
      antibiotics for 2 additional weeks. RESULTS: The patient had gradual improvement 
      of his symptoms within the first 48 hours. At the latest follow-up visit, he had 
      fully recovered and his fracture had healed. CONCLUSIONS: The halo device should 
      not be used for patients with a previous cranioplasty, especially if the pins
      cannot be inserted at other safe areas of the skull. A thorough medical history
      and physical examination of the skull are important before the application of a
      halo device. Computed tomography of the skull may be necessary before elective
      halo application for patients with concomitant head trauma, confusion, or
      intoxication and for patients with a previous cranioplasty to ascertain the
      safest pin sites.

AB  - We report a case of a brainstem infarction and hemorrhage seen in a 21-year-old
      female with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) during treating retroperitoneal
      abscess. SLE has been treated with prednisolone and mizoribine for 4 years. The
      patient with right back and lower abdominal pain visited our hospital. Computed
      tomography (CT) revealed retroperitoneal abscess over surrounding right kidney,
      horizontal part of duodenum and in front of psoas muscle. Drainage was done with 
      indwelled right single J catheter and penrose drain. Retroperitoneal abscess was 
      much smaller, but, post drainage day 17, high fever, unconsciousness, down-blood 
      pressure and down-beat nystagmus appeared suddenly. Brain CT scan revealed a
      brainstem wide infarction and hemorrhage spot. Pulse therapy with steroid was
      done, however unfortunately the patient was dead after 6 days.

      transesophageal echocardiography. Cultures of epidural aspirate, surgical
      specimen, and blood all grew Candida albicans. She received surgical drainage of 
      the spinal epidural abscess and i.v. amphotericin B 1 mg/kg/day for eight weeks. 
      Clinical symptoms improved gradually and she was discharged without neurologic
      sequelae. She remained well and continued to lead an active life two years after 
      discharge.

AB  - A 35-year-old healthy gravida 2 para 2 developed a spinal epidural abscess after 
      uneventful obstetric epidural analgesia. The diagnosis was confirmed by
      gadolinium-enhanced MRI; immediate surgical drainage combined with long-term
      antibiotic treatment led to complete recovery. The symptoms and possible
      contributing factors (e.g. immunological impairment of the patient, duration of
      the catheterization, violation of hygienic standards, type of disinfectant and
      dressing) are discussed. Vigilance is essential to avoid complications in
      patients with epidural catheters, even after it has been removed, in order to
      introduce appropriate diagnostic and therapeutic measures without delay.
      Immediate treatment is decisive for long term prognosis which should be
      introduced before neurological dysfunction appears.

TI  - Pyogenic spondylitis in an S1-S2 immobile segment.
PG  - 588-9
AB  - STUDY DESIGN: A case of pyogenic spondylitis in S1-S2 is presented. OBJECTIVE: To
      describe the diagnosis and management of this rare spondylitis. SUMMARY OF
      BACKGROUND DATA: The segment including the first and second sacral vertebrae is
      not mobile. Therefore, discitis of S1-S2 and adjacent spondylitis is very rare.
      To the authors' knowledge, this is the first reported case of infectious
      spondylitis in an immobile segment: S1-S2. METHODS: In addition to radiography
      and bone scintigraphy, magnetic resonance imaging was used to confirm the
      diagnosis. Changes consistent with infectious spondylitis were shown, including
      an epidural abscess. RESULTS: The patient was treated with laparoscopic drainage 
      and biopsy. Staphylococcus aureus was cultured, and adequate antibiotics were
      administered. Repeat magnetic resonance imaging at approximately 4 months
      demonstrated normal signal intensity and disappearance of the abscess.
      CONCLUSION: Findings from this study show that pyogenic spondylitis can occur in 
      immobile S1-S2.

TI  - The results of anterior radical debridement and anterior instrumentation in
      Pott's disease and comparison with other surgical techniques.
PG  - 39-68
AB  - Classic procedure in the treatment of vertebral tuberculosis is drainage of the
      abscess, curettage of the devitalized vertebra and application of antituberculous
      chemotherapy regimen. Posterior instrumentation results are encouraging in the
      prevention or treatment of late kyphosis; however, a second stage operation is
      needed. Recently, posterolateral or transpedicular drainage without anterior
      drainage or posterior instrumentation following anterior drainage in the same
      session is preferred to avoid kyphotic deformity. Seventy-six patients with
      spinal tuberculosis were operated in the 1st Department of Orthopaedics and
      Traumatology, Ankara Social Security Hospital, between January 1987 and January
      1997. There were four children in our series. Average follow-up period was 36.1
      +/- 14.5 months and the average age at the time of operation was 40.8 +/- 15.2
      years. This study reports the surgical results of 45 patients with Pott's disease
      who had anterior radical debridement with anterior fusion and anterior
      instrumentation [14 patients with Z-plate and 31 patients with
      Cotrel-Dubousset-Hopf (CDH system)]. The results are compared with those of 8
      patients who had posterolateral drainage and posterior fusion, 12 patients who
      had only anterior drainage and anterior strut grafting and, 11 patients who had
      posterior instrumentation following anterior radical debridement in the same
      session in terms of fusion rates, correction of kyphotic deformity, recurrence
      rate and clinical results. All patients had one year consecutive triple drug
      therapy. Preoperative 23.2 degrees +/- 12.5 degrees local kyphosis angle was
      lowered to 6.1 degrees +/- 6.9 degrees with a correction rate of 77.4 +/- 22.3%. 
      When the other three groups which had been instrumented were compared, the
      correction rates in the local kyphosis angle values were not statistically
      different and the variation in loss of correction at the last follow-up was also 
      statistically insignificant. The sagittal contour of the involved vertebra's
      region did not change in the uninstrumented group, while it did so in
      instrumented groups which had normal range values postoperatively. Overall, 27
      patients had neurologic deficits preoperatively. Twenty of these (74.1%) had
      complete, and 5 (18.5%) had partial recovery with a combined 92.6% neurologic
      improvement. All the patients had a solid fusion mass at the last controls.
      Reactivation was not seen. Additionally, contrary to the common belief, anterior 
      instrumentation which anterior autologous strut grafting following anterior
      radical debridement can be a good treatment option with low complication rate,
      high correction rate in acute local kyphosis, and high fusion rate.

TI  - Unilateral psoas abscess following posterior transpedicular stabilization of the 
      lumbar spine.
PG  - 588-90
AB  - A case of unilateral psoas abscess in a 58-year-old patient, shortly after
      posterior lower spine stabilization and fusion for spinal stenosis using
      transpedicular spine fixation is reported. The diagnosis was delayed because the 
      patient's symptoms were referred to the thigh and the plain roentgenograms were
      negative for pathology. The technetium scintigram and computed tomography (CT)
      helped localization, diagnosis and treatment of the psoas abscess. Percutaneous
      CT-guided drainage was followed by recurrence of the abscess, and open surgical
      evacuation was performed successfully in combination with antibiotic treatment
      for 8 weeks. Psoas abscess should always be suspected when recurrent pain is
      associated with fever and elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate after
      instrumentation of the lumbar spine. Hardware of a low profile and volume should 
      be used to decrease dead space in the fusion area, and the volume of bone
      substitutes should be limited for the same reason.

TI  - [Epidural abscess following repeated epidural catheter placement for delivery].
PG  - 960-3
AB  - This case report describes an epidural abscess with pseudomonas aeruginosa after 
      the placement of two epidural catheters within one hour in a healthy 29-year old 
      primipara. Spontaneous delivery occurred after an episiotomy about 4 hours later.
      Afterwards the epidural catheter was removed completely and again 5 hours later
      the woman was discharged from the hospital. On postpartal day 3 the patient
      experienced lumbar back pain, slight weakness of both legs and some difficulties 
      to urinate. On day 14 after delivery magnetic resonance imaging revealed an
      epidural abscess at the height of the 4th and 5th lumbar vertebrae. Immediately a
      neurosurgical debridement and drainage was performed. The patient was discharged 
      at home on the 10th postoperative day without neurological sequelae. In this case
      report a hematogenic infection was considered. The traumatized tissue from the
      two catheter placements within one hour could easily be colonized with
      pseudomonas aeruginosa originating from a transient bacteriemia due to an
      episiotomy inspite of adequate local disinfection measures. The case report also 
      underlines the need for proper information of the patient about the possibilities
      of complications after epidural anesthesia in outside patients.

TI  - Ilio-psoas abscess in neonates: treatment by ultrasound-guided percutaneous
      drainage.
PG  - 677-80
AB  - Ilio-psoas abscess is rare in neonates and is usually treated by surgical
      drainage. We report two cases of ilio-psoas abscess in 15- and 21-day-old infants
      successfully treated by US-guided percutaneous drainage as a supplement to
      antibiotic therapy. Clinical improvement was observed within 24-48 h of drainage 
      and subsequent imaging demonstrated resolution of the abscess cavity. The
      analysis of these cases and of those previously reported indicates that imaging
      is essential for diagnosis. In neonates, US-guided percutaneous drainage may
      represent the first-choice treatment of this disease in association with
      antibiotic therapy.

TI  - Chronic paronychia, osteomyelitis, and paravertebral abscess in a child with
      blastomycosis.
PG  - 245-8
AB  - Blastomycosis is an unusual fungal infection in children. It is often a chronic
      infection characterized by granulomatous and suppurative lesions. Clinical
      manifestations include either pulmonary findings or disseminated disease.
      Disseminated blastomycosis usually begins with a lung infection that spreads to
      the skin, bones, and central nervous system. This is a case report of a child
      with chronic blastomycosis presenting with chronic paronychia, fever, cough,
      malaise, and back pain. The child underwent surgical drainage of a paravertebral 
      abscess and administration of intravenous amphotericin B. He was discharged in
      good condition on oral therapy with ketoconazole. The literature on
      blastomycosis, with particular emphasis on clinical presentations and management,
      is reviewed. When the history and physical examination suggest a chronic
      granulomatous or disseminated disease, such as tuberculosis, the physician must
      include blastomycosis in the differential.

TI  - Spinal epidural abscess in a young child.
PG  - E39
AB  - This is a case report of a spinal epidural abscess, caused by Staphylococcus
      aureus, in a 3-year-old girl. The child presented with fever and hip pain, but
      without any neurologic deficit. After normal plain films and a normal bone scan
      were obtained, the diagnosis was made via magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The
      neurosurgery and pediatric infectious disease teams evaluated the patient, and
      the decision was made to forego surgical drainage and to treat medically with
      appropriate intravenous and then oral antibiotics. Several months later, the
      child was doing well without any signs of neurologic sequelae. Because of the
      rarity of this disease in children, the treatment guidelines are controversial.
      Many suggest that a spinal epidural abscess must be drained surgically. Our
      experience adds to the literature a case of a child successfully treated with
      antibiotics alone. We believe that this success is related to the fact that the
      child was diagnosed by MRI early in the course of the disease and that she never 
      displayed any neurologic deficits.

PG  - 95-8
AB  - The presentation and management of psoas abscess was studied prospectively in 5
      patients and retrospectively in 4. 3 patients had bilateral abscesses. All
      patients had back pain and a mass in loin or iliac fossa. 7 patients had no hip
      findings. One patient had a perinephric abscess and another had radiological
      features of tuberculosis of the spine. In the other seven no cause for the
      abscess could be identified. Ultrasonography demonstrated the abscess in all
      patients; CT scanning done in 5 patients was confirmatory. Drainage was done by
      an extraperitoneal route. Biopsy of the abscess wall in 2 patients demonstrated
      tuberculosis. They, the patient with TB spine and 3 others put empirically on
      anti-tuberculosis chemotherapy responded well. The perinephric abscess grew
      Pseudomonas sensitive to gentamycin, but she and two other patients died due to
      multiorgan failure.

TI  - Neonatal cervical osteomyelitis with paraspinal abscess and Erb's palsy. A case
      report and brief review of the literature.
PG  - 230-3
AB  - An unusual case of pyogenic cervical osteomyelitis is reported in a newborn who
      immediately after birth had no movements in the left shoulder. There was a
      fullness in the left cervical region. Left Erb's palsy due to an unrecognized
      birth trauma was diagnosed in a peripheral hospital. Later, the child developed
      fever and a significant swelling in the left cervical region. On transfer to our 
      institution, the X-rays of the cervical spine, ultrasound and computed tomography
      (CT) established the diagnosis of C(6) cervical osteomyelitis and paraspinal
      abscess which extended to the posterior triangle of the neck. The abscess was
      drained, and the lamina and lateral mass of the C(6) vertebra were debrided.
      Staphylococcus aureus was grown from the pus. The patient was put on long-term
      antibiotics to which he responded very well, and he became asymptomatic. In the
      immediate post-operative period, some movements at the left shoulder were noted, 
      and at 6-month follow-up in the out-patient clinic, the child was virtually
      normal with near-complete regeneration of the C(6) lamina and lateral mass.

TI  - Pyogenic vertebral osteomyelitis/disc infection.
PG  - 59-75
AB  - Spinal osteomyelitis has been known about for centuries. Granulomatous infection 
      was the principal offender in the past, but nowadays, with an increased number of
      patients at 'risk', the proportion of pyogenic infections has risen. Awareness of
      this is the essence of early diagnosis. The advent of magnetic resonance imaging 
      has proved a major milestone; with its high sensitivity and specificity, it is an
      essential part of the diagnostic work-up. The treatment of spinal osteomyelitis
      follows the same basic principles as for any infection. Once the diagnosis has
      been established, early conservative treatment is commenced. Debridement,
      drainage of any abscesses, spinal decompression and stabilization are options in 
      surgical treatment. The successful use of metallic implants to achieve correction
      and stabilization is probably helped by good perfusion of the vertebral body and 
      accompanying good soft tissue coverage. The eradication of infection is therefore
      still possible.

TI  - Postsurgical prevertebral abscess of the cervical spine.
PG  - 1137-41
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Prevertebral abscess formation is an uncommon occurrence following
      cervical spine fusion surgery. Abscesses may present early or in a delayed
      fashion and require surgical drainage and long-term antibiotic treatment. The
      issues of osteomyelitis and the need for plate removal remain unresolved. STUDY
      DESIGN: A case series of six tetraplegic patients admitted for rehabilitation to 
      the Chaim Sheba Medical Center (Tel Hashomer, Israel) is presented. METHODS: Five
      patients were trauma patients; one patient underwent repeated procedures and
      irradiation for tumor of the cervical spine. All patients developed prevertebral 
      abscesses after a mean period of 30 days from their fusion surgery. Computed
      tomography scan was used in all patients to establish the diagnosis and define
      the extent of the infective process. All patients underwent one or more drainage 
      procedures. The plate was removed in two patients at 1 and 4 months. RESULTS:
      Infection completely resolved in four patient and was refractory in one patient
      with malignant tumor, and a chronic small fistula remained in one case.
      Staphylococcus aureus was the main infective organism, but mixed infections were 
      the rule. Even for a protracted course of infection, no significant osteomyelitis
      was encountered. CONCLUSIONS: Abscess formation after instrumentation of the neck
      may be more common than formerly recognized. Despite the prolonged course of
      disease and treatment, osteomyelitis is not a major concern. There is no
      automatic indication for plate removal to control infection, although plating may
      be safely removed after 10 to 12 weeks if the neck is explored and the cervical
      spine is stable. A high index of suspicion is warranted, and early recognition
      and diagnosis, prompt surgical drainage under general anesthesia, and long-term
      antibiotic treatment are key for eradication of the infective process.
      Prophylactic antibiotics may be of value. Meticulous antisepsis and surgical
      technique should be maintained to reduce the incidence of these severe
      complications.

TI  - A retrospective study of surgical and conservative treatment for spinal
      extradural abscess.
PG  - 67-71
AB  - The management of spinal extradural abscess (SEA), particularly the choice
      between surgical and conservative treatment, is controversial. We therefore
      undertook a retrospective study of patients admitted with this diagnosis: Details
      of presentation, treatment and outcome were obtained by review of inpatient notes
      and radiology. Twenty-five individuals with SEA aged 10-79 years were admitted
      between 1989 and 1995. Nine were treated non-operatively with antibiotics, of
      which three also underwent diagnostic CT-guided biopsy, and 16 underwent surgical
      drainage. There was no significant difference in the neurological features at
      presentation between the two groups. Two patients (8%) died; 11 (44%) patients
      remained the same and 12 (48%) improved following treatment. Four patients
      treated conservatively (44%) and seven treated surgically (43%) were capable of
      return to work or school, whilst a further seven patients (three treated
      conservatively and four treated surgically) were able to lead independent lives. 
      No significant difference in outcome was demonstrated between patients treated
      non-operatively and those treated surgically. We conclude that certain carefully 
      selected patients can be treated conservatively, but that surgery should remain
      the mainstay of management.

TI  - Aggressive thoracic actinomycosis complicated by vertebral osteomyelitis and
      epidural abscess leading to spinal cord compression.
PG  - 745-8
AB  - STUDY DESIGN: Report of a successfully diagnosed and treated case of spinal cord 
      compression due to epidural actinomycosis. OBJECTIVE: To illustrate that proper
      use of imaging strategy can greatly facilitate diagnosis and management of this
      rare condition. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Spinal actinomycosis causing epidural
      abscess and significant spinal cord compression is an uncommon condition.
      Although diagnosis is difficult, favorable results are widely reported when
      specific therapy is instituted. METHODS: A 32-year-old Chinese man had extensive 
      dorsal thoracic soft tissue swelling and lower limb weakness. Collapse of the T5 
      vertebral body was found on plain radiographs with mediastinal infiltrates on
      chest radiograph. It took magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to fully delineate the
      epidural abscess and dorsal muscular abscesses, which were not depicted by
      computed tomographic (CT) scan. Diagnosis was made by examination of CT-guided
      aspirate and tissue recovered during surgery by a microbiologist. The patient
      received high-dose intravenous penicillin and prompt spinal decompression once
      diagnosis of actinomycosis was confirmed. RESULTS: The dorsal muscular abscesses 
      and upper thoracic epidural abscess resolved rapidly after intravenous
      antibiotics and surgical drainage. This was well documented by follow-up MRI and 
      the full recovery of motor power and lower limb sensation in the patient.
      CONCLUSIONS: High clinical suspicion and proper use of imaging data led to timely
      diagnosis of this rare case of mediastinal, epidural, and intramuscular thoracic 
      actinomycosis. Specific antibiotic therapy and timely, well-targeted surgical
      intervention greatly improve the outcome of this condition.

TI  - [Giant psoas abscess with aggressive extension: report of a case].
PG  - 835-7
AB  - We report a case of giant psoas abscess with aggressive extension outside the
      muscles of the iliopsoas component. A 57-year-old man was admitted to our
      hospital, presenting with right flank pain and severe general malaise. He had
      been diabetic, but no treatment had been performed for diabetes. Leukocytosis,
      positive CRP and hyperglycemia were noted, but he was nearly afebrile on
      admission. Computerized tomography revealed a large multilocular mass in the
      right retroperitoneal space involving the ipsilateral psoas muscle. The diagnosis
      was not apparent until the 12th hospital day, when moderate grade fever was noted
      and brownish purulent fluid was obtained by percutaneous puncture of the mass.
      Staphylococcus aureus was isolated on culture. Antibiotic chemotherapy was
      started, and ultrasound-guided percutaneous drainage was then performed under the
      diagnosis of psoas abscess. At that time, the abscess was aggressively extending 
      from the iliopsoas component into the pelvic floor, involving the rectus muscle, 
      the gluteal muscles and formation of subucutaneous lesions. At 46 days after
      drainage, surgical resection of the abscess with removal of the adjucent tissue
      was performed because of persistent discharge of pus and multiple residual
      lesions. The postoperative course was uneventful, and there has been no
      recurrence. Many cases of psoas abscess have been reported in the Japanese
      literature. Prompt drainage, either percutaneously or surgically are required.
      Surgical resection of the abscess, with not only opening the cavity but also
      removal of the adjacent tissue, may be recommended in some cases, especially
      those diffuse or multilocular lesions.

      Abscess involving the entire spinal cord is extremely rare and awareness of such 
      an event could avoid delay in evacuation of the absess. METHODS: The incidence,
      clinical presentation, radiological investigations, treatment and etiology of
      intramedullary spinal cord abscess in 100 consecutive cases are discussed.
      RESULTS: Intramedullary spinal cord abscesses are rare. Presently, only five
      cases of holocord intramedullary abscess are described. In our analysis of 100
      cases of intramedullary abscess, a male preponderance was found. The first and
      the third decades were the most common age groups. Prognosis is poor if treatment
      is delayed. Contrast-enhanced MRI is the ideal investigation for diagnosis.
      Prompt surgical drainage of the abscess with appropriate antibiotic therapy is
      mandatory since the natural course of the disease has a very unfavourable
      outcome. Staphylococcus and Streptococcus were the most common causative
      organisms. CONCLUSION: Intramedullary spinal cord abscess along the entire length
      of spinal cord is rare. A thorough history with precise clinical localisation, a 
      high index of suspicion, contrast-enhanced MRI at appropriate level and prompt
      surgical drainage with appropriate antibiotic therapy are key to the eventual
      outcome and prognosis.

      abscesses.
PG  - 257-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: A 14-year-old boy was admitted because of lumbago and high fever.
      METHODS/RESULTS: Computed tomography scans revealed psoas, piriformis and gluteal
      abscesses as well as right iliac vein thrombus. A right femoral venogram
      demonstrated compression from the psoas abscess and thrombosis of the common
      iliac vein. Appropriate surgical drainage, administration of antibiotics and
      anticoagulant therapy were effective in the present case. CONCLUSIONS: This is
      the first report of primary psoas abscess associated with vein thrombosis and is 
      also unique in that abscesses were multiple without predisposing diseases or
      trauma.

PG  - 1001-3
AB  - A 59-year-old woman had persistent sepsis after abdominal operations because of a
      volvulus and subsequently a retroperitoneal abscess, in spite of antibiotic
      treatment against Klebsiella pneumoniae, which grew in blood cultures. During
      abscess drainage, a haemorrhage from the infrarenal part of the aorta had
      occurred; in view of a presumed aortitis this part had been replaced by a
      bifemoral bypass. Computer tomography revealed intraosseous formation of gas in
      vertebrae and pelvis. At operation, abscesses were drained and necrotomy and
      sequestrotomy of the bone were performed. Cultures of the pus from the iliac
      crests showed K. pneumoniae. The antibiotic management was changed; the wounds
      were flushed regularly. After exposure of the wounds still draining after 6
      months and vascular surgery because of occlusion of the bypass after 7 months,
      the patient recovered well. She died 2 years later from a cerebral haemorrhage.

PG  - 1123-4
AB  - A 47-year-old man was admitted with septic fever over a few days. A CT-scan
      showed a psoas abscess, which was drained by surgery. In the meantime antibiotics
      were started. In spite of this treatment, he continued to have septic fever. Bone
      scintigraphy and MR-scan showed activity in the right sacroiliac joint compatible
      with sacroiliitis. The joint was opened surgically and revised. The patient was
      treated with antibiotics for nine weeks and was fully restituted. It must be
      concluded that the psoas abscess was secondary to the sacroiliitis, a rare event.

TI  - Craniocervical junction tuberculosis: a rare but dangerous disease.
PG  - 21-5; discussion 26
AB  - BACKGROUND: Mycobacterium tuberculosis of the cervical spine is a rare but
      dangerous manifestation of extra-pulmonary tuberculosis. The clinical picture
      ranges from early, nonspecific, insidious symptoms to severe neurological
      complications and death, attributed to craniocervical junction instability and
      cervicomedullary compression. The different lines of management include
      antituberculous medication with traction and external fixation or adjunctive
      surgery (debridement and stabilization) in patients with severe or persistent
      neurological complications and/or vertebral instability. METHODS: We describe two
      patients with advanced craniocervical junction tuberculosis. The early clinical
      picture was nonspecific in Case 1 and obscured by psychiatric illness in Case 2. 
      The detailed clinical and radiological findings, and the management, will be
      described. Involvement of the occipital condyles and foramen magnum, which has
      not been reported previously, will be demonstrated. RESULTS: Both cases underwent
      transoral biopsy, aspiration, and debridement of retropharyngeal abscess
      (granuloma). Histological and tissue culture studies proved the abscesses were
      tuberculous and anti-tuberculous medications were started. Case 1 showed complete
      resolution of the clinical and radiological findings. Case 2 developed
      cardiorespiratory arrest while in a halo jacket. He was resuscitated but remained
      quadriplegic and semiconscious; he developed nosocomial gram negative pneumonia. 
      He was referred back to his local hospital where he died 1 year later.
      CONCLUSIONS: Tuberculosis is an infrequent but notable cause of cervicomedullary 
      compression. It should be suspected in patients with infective spondylitis who
      are immunocompromised or reside in an area highly endemic for tuberculosis.
      Management strategies include antituberculosis medication, transoral biopsy and
      drainage of the abscess, traction and external fixation, posterior decompression,
      and internal fixation, according to the clinical and radiological findings.

TI  - Suppurative intracranial complications of sinusitis.
PG  - 1635-42
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To familiarize the contemporary surgeon with the pathogenesis,
      diagnosis, and appropriate management of suppurative intracranial complications
      of sinusitis. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective chart review. METHODS: All patients
      admitted to the University of Virginia Health Sciences Center with a diagnosis of
      intracranial suppuration between 1992 and 1997 were reviewed. RESULTS: One
      hundred seventy-six cases were identified, of which 15 patients had 22
      suppurative intracranial complications of sinusitis. These were epidural abscess 
      (23%), subdural empyema (18%), meningitis (18%), cerebral abscess (14%), superior
      sagittal sinus thrombosis (9%), cavernous sinus thrombosis (9%), and
      osteomyelitis (9%). CONCLUSIONS: The diagnosis of suppurative intracranial
      complications of sinusitis requires a high index of suspicion and confirmation by
      imaging. Central to the success of treatment is the management of the primary
      source of sepsis within the paranasal sinuses in combination with neurosurgical
      drainage and intravenous antibiotics. This approach has resulted in a mortality
      rate of 7% and morbidity of 13%, which compare favorably with previous series.

TI  - [Psoas muscle abscess. Description of a series of 19 cases].
PG  - 118-22
AB  - Abscess of the psoas muscle (PA) is every more frequently observed in recent
      years. The PA diagnosed in the authors' center over a period of 91 months are
      presented, analyzing the main clinical features, microbiologic causal agents,
      risk factors, treatment and the differences between primary and secondary PA. A
      total of 19 cases of which 14 were secondary PA (73.7%) and 5 primary PA (26.3%) 
      were diagnosed. The main foci of infection of the former were the bone and the
      genitourinary tract, with intestinal infection being rare. The most frequent
      clinical data were lumbar pain with possible irradiation to the lower limb,
      fever, and leucocytosis with neutrophilia. Gram negative and enteric anaerobes
      were the bacteria most often identified, followed by Staphylococcus aureus and
      Mycobacterium tuberculosis. In a high percentage of patients (57.8%) a history of
      immunodeficiency was reported. In regard to treatment, surgical drainage was
      performed in 5 cases (26.3%), while ten cases (52.6%) were treated by DPCT. Four 
      patients (21%) were exclusively treated with antibiotics. Recurrence was observed
      in three cases (15.3%) of the DPCT group requiring new drainage. Of all the
      cases, 18 were cured while one death occurred, being attributed to the underlying
      tumoral disease of advanced stage. The authors believe DPCT to be a good
      therapeutic option in both primary and secondary PA, thereby avoiding the risks
      of major surgery. In the cases with no underlying immunodeficiency the existence 
      of secondary PA should be discarded as occurred in 7 out of 8 cases with no
      history of immunodeficiency in this series of patients.

TI  - Primary pyogenic abscess of the psoas muscle.
PG  - 41-3
AB  - During a six-year period, eleven persons with primary pyogenic abscess of the
      psoas muscle were treated at the Mackay Memorial Hospital. Five were males and
      six were females and their average age was 47.2 years (range 6-83 years). The
      abscess was identified by CT in 7 patients, MRI in 2 and ultrasonography in 1.
      One abscess was found during laparotomy. Treatment included extraperitoneal
      drainage of the abscess in 7 patients and CT guided aspiration in 3. One patient 
      improved after antibiotic therapy and they all recovered after treatment. The
      diagnosis of primary pyogenic abscess requires a high index of suspicion and the 
      best treatment is early operative drainage and administration of systemic
      antibiotics.

TI  - Vertebral osteomyelitis due to Rhodococcus equi in a liver transplant recipient.
PG  - 749-52
AB  - Rhodococcus equi is a rare but well-documented cause of cavitary pneumonia in
      immunocompromised patients. In this report the first case of R. equi infection
      manifesting as vertebral osteomyelitis is described. A 39-year-old liver
      transplant recipient presented with recurrent pneumonia and a pleura-based lung
      abscess and subsequently developed osteomyelitis of the lower thoracic spine.
      Surgical debridement and prolonged treatment with rifabutin and clarithromycin
      resulted in clinical cure. In the literature, 12 other cases of R. equi infection
      in solid-organ transplant recipients have been reported. Ten of these patients
      had documented pulmonary disease and seven had extrapulmonary manifestations.
      Prolonged antibiotic therapy and surgical drainage resulted in clinical
      improvement in > 90% of the reported cases.

AB  - 2 children with pyogenic liver abscesses were hospitalized during the past 2
      years. A 6-year-old boy had high fever and hepatomegaly, and a large liver
      abscess was found in the right hepatic lobe. Streptococcus milleri was isolated
      from the pus. Treatment with a combination of prolonged drainage of the abscess
      and antibiotic therapy was successful. A 4-month-old girl who had prolonged fever
      was found to have osteomyelitis of 3 thoracic vertebrae and 2 liver abscesses in 
      the right lobe. She was treated successfully with broad spectrum antibiotics.
      Additional workup revealed that she had chronic granulomatous disease.

AB  - An 18-month-old Caucasian female began with a high fever. She developed swelling 
      in one finger and one toe. Abdominal ultrasound revealed multiple abscesses in
      her spleen. Multiple blood culture and splenic abscess aspirations grew no
      pathogens. She had transient response to multiple antibiotics and splenic abscess
      drainage, but fever returned along with subcutaneous nodules. Culture of splenic 
      tissue from her second splenic drainage eventually grew one organism identified
      as Actinomyces naeslundii. Therapy with high dose penicillin followed by
      amoxicillin p.o. and total splenectomy led to complete recovery.

TI  - Spinal epidural abscess--a case report.
PG  - 457-61
AB  - Despite modern medical advances, the morbidity and mortality rates associated
      with spinal epidural abscess remain significant, and the diagnosis is elusive.
      The incidence of spinal epidural abscess is approximately one to two cases per
      10,000 among all patients admitted to hospitals. The symptoms of spinal epidural 
      abscess are varied but include lower back pain, fever, local tenderness and
      neurological deficit especially in such high risk groups as patients with
      diabetes, intravenous drug abuse, chronic renal failure, alcoholism, liver
      disease and immunocompromization. Accumulation of data is difficult in that many 
      physicians will never see a case during their careers. Herein, we present a case 
      with lower back pain associated with both lower legs weakness. His abdomenon CT
      revealed retroperitonium and right perirenal abscess. External drainage as well
      as antibiotic treatment was done immediately. However, the lower legs weakness
      became severe and a lumbar spine MRI revealed T11-L4 epidural abscesses and L2-3 
      intervertebral space pus formation. Then, the patient was transfered to our
      Neurosurgical Ward for further treatment. His postoperative condition improved in
      both lower legs. This case report is to enhance the recognition and treatment of 
      spinal epidural abscess, a rare affliction.

PG  - 610-4
AB  - HISTORY AND CLINICAL FINDINGS: For about a year a 28-year-old Nigerian had been
      suffering from diffuse bone pain, intermittent fever, weight loss and weakness.
      Physical examination was unremarkable except for a swelling at the sternal angle.
      INVESTIGATIONS: The tuberculin test was clearly positive and tests for
      inflammatory disease were elevated, but the chest radiograph was normal. Bone
      scintigraphy demonstrated multiple sites of increased storage in the ribs and
      vertebral column. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a large paravertebral
      abscess, which was needled under computed tomography monitoring. Polymerase chain
      reaction of the aspirate demonstrated Mycobacterium tuberculosis. TREATMENT AND
      COURSE: While initial treatment with combined isoniazid, streptomycin, rifampicin
      and pyrazinamide, the first two drugs had to be discontinued, the microorganism
      not being sensitive to them, and were replaced by ethambutol and amikacin. The
      abscess was drained and the vertebral fracture surgically stabilised. There were 
      no neurological abnormalities and the lesions largely healed. CONCLUSION: Even
      without pulmonary involvement tuberculosis must be included in the differential
      diagnosis of rheumatic diseases with joint and vertebral column involvement, such
      as the SAPHO syndrome and other inflammatory bone diseases.

      abscess. Apropos of a case].
PG  - 64-8
AB  - We report an unusually uncommon case of genitourinary rhabdomyosarcoma in a child
      which was chemoresistant and complicated by a primary psoas abscess which
      presented as a pelvic mass associated with an abscess of the right iliac fossa.
      Ultrasound and CT investigations suggested the diagnosis of a centropelvic tumor 
      which was confirmed at puncture-aspiration. MRI was most contributive giving a
      precise description of the local extension. Intensive multi-drug chemotherapy
      would appear to have improved outcome in patients with poor-prognosis Maurer
      group III tumors. In exceptional cases when no tumor response is obtained,
      carcinological surgery with large dissection, possibly with adjuvant
      radiotherapy, is indicated. Percutaneous drainage of the deep psoas abscess is as
      effective as classical surgery and spares the abdominal wall, particularly
      important if a second operation should be needed. Multidisciplinary management is
      required for the treatment of this highly malignant tumor.

PG  - 964-6
AB  - Infectious complications of spinal or epidural anaesthesia are rare, particularly
      after spinal anaesthesia. Most of them consist of a meningitis. We report a case 
      of epidural abscess due to Staphylococcus aureus following spinal anaesthesia in 
      a 62-year-old diabetic patient, diagnosed 45 days after the puncture with
      bacterial samples and magnetic resonance imaging. The pejorative neurological
      outcome required a laminectomy in spite of an efficient anti-staphylococcal
      treatment.

TI  - [Psoas abscess: diagnostic dilemma in childhood].
PG  - 402-4, 455
AB  - A series of 16 children diagnosed as having a psoas abscess or deep iliac
      lymphadenitis seen over a 25-year period (1970-1994) is presented. 10 were
      treated conservatively while 5 were drained surgically and 1 percutaneously under
      imaging guidance. The presenting signs and symptoms may mimic the frequently seen
      entities, acute appendicitis and acute hip arthritis. Lower abdominal and
      inguinal pain, limp, fever and increased white count are common in all of these
      conditions. Accurate differential diagnosis is necessary to avoid unnecessary
      surgery due to a wrong diagnosis. Ultrasonography is preferred for diagnosis.
      Antibiotic therapy should be instituted immediately, aimed primarily at
      Staphylococcus aureus, the most common causative agent, although other organisms 
      may be implicated. When a psoas abscess has been diagnosed, surgery and drainage 
      are indicated. One of the preferred approaches is percutaneous drainage under
      imaging guidance. Convalescence is usually rapid and without late sequelae.

TI  - Spinal epidural abscess: evaluation of factors influencing outcome.
PG  - 958-64
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to critically evaluate the predictive
      efficacy of various clinical factors in spinal epidural abscess influencing
      outcome after surgical and/or medical treatment. METHODS: A retrospective
      analysis of 41 cases of spinal epidural abscess treated at Henry Ford Hospital
      between 1984 and 1992 was performed. RESULTS: Thirty patients underwent open
      surgery and received antibiotic therapy, and 11 patients received medical
      treatment alone. After a mean follow-up period of 20.9 months (range, 4-45 mo),
      24 patients (58.5%) had no or minimal deficits, 9 patients (22%) had severe
      paresis or plegia and/or bowel/bladder dysfunction, and 8 patients (19.5%) died. 
      Univariate analysis revealed patient age, degree of thecal sac compression,
      spinal location, surgical findings, and septic presentation to be significantly
      associated with outcome. In multiple logistic regression analysis, increasing age
      and degree of thecal sac compression were the only factors with significant
      independent association with poor outcome (P = 0.01 for both). A simple grading
      system (Grades 0-III) was developed, with patient age, degree of thecal sac
      compression, and duration of symptoms as the determining criteria. The incidence 
      of poor outcome for patients with Grade 0 was 0%, compared to 85.7% for patients 
      with Grade III. CONCLUSION: We conclude that long-term outcome after treatment of
      spinal epidural abscess can be predicted with the use of the proposed grading
      scheme. Surgical drainage plus parenterally administered antibiotics remains the 
      recommended treatment, although medical treatment alone can also be used for
      certain patients.

TI  - Pneumococcal pyomyositis. Case report, review of the literature, and comparison
      with classic pyomyositis caused by other bacteria.
PG  - 1470-4
AB  - Pyomyositis is caused by staphylococci in 70% to 90% of patients. We report a
      case of pneumococcal pyomyositis (PP), review the 11 cases previously published, 
      and compare the features of pneumococcal pyomyositis with those of classic
      (nonpneumococcal) pyomyositis. Several clinical characteristics have been
      identified that are notably different in both groups. Psoas muscle involvement
      was observed in two thirds of the patients with PP, and a source for the
      infection was identified in half of the patients. Patients with PP were older
      than those with classic pyomyositis. Men were affected less often than women with
      PP, but the opposite was the rule in classic pyomyositis. The systemic response
      to the infection was more prominent in patients infected with pneumococci than
      from other causes. Most patients with PP were successfully treated with
      antibiotics and drainage. Secondary meningitis was observed in 3 patients with
      psoas muscle abscess caused by pneumococci. Mortality is low in pyomyositis
      regardless of the causative pathogen.

TI  - Multifocal metachronous epidural abscesses of the spine. A case report.
PG  - 1094-7
AB  - STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective case report of a patient who had a lumbar epidural 
      abscess treated surgically who then developed a cervical epidural abscess that
      also required surgical treatment. OBJECTIVES: To describe a patient in whom
      treatment of a single epidural abscess with surgery and antibiotics was not
      sufficient to eradicate the systemic infection. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA:
      Epidural abscesses are most commonly seen after invasive procedures that violate 
      the epidural space. Epidural abscesses are usually a solitary event occurring in 
      only one location and are usually treatable with surgical drainage and parenteral
      antibiotics. METHODS: An elderly patient presented with neck and shoulder pain
      and fever. Evaluation revealed degenerative disease of the cervical spine. Within
      a week, she developed a cauda equina syndrome secondary to a lumber epidural
      abscess. The abscess was drained and intravenous antibiotics were given.
      Seventeen days later, while still receiving antibiotics, she developed a cervical
      epidural abscess which also required surgical drainage. RESULTS: The patient
      showed gradual improvement in her neurologic status. No recurrence of either
      epidural abscess was observed. CONCLUSIONS: An epidural abscess may represent a
      serious systemic infection that requires aggressive treatment. Close follow-up is
      necessary to ensure that the infection has been eradicated and that no recurrent 
      abscess has formed in the same or a different location. Aggressive antibiotic
      treatment is also strongly recommended.

TI  - Retroperitoneal abscess after normal delivery. A report of two cases.
PG  - 276-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: Retroperitoneal abscess is a rare complication of normal labor and
      delivery, and no apparent etiology is evident. CASES: We report on two patient
      who presented with back and leg pain soon after normal deliveries. While the
      condition was initially clinically misdiagnosed, ultrasonography and computed
      tomography demonstrated retroperitoneal collections and aided in guided
      percutaneous drainage. After a protracted course of antibiotic treatment and
      daily irrigation, the collections resolved. CONCLUSION: Ultrasonography and
      computed tomography were invaluable in the diagnosis and guided drainage of rare 
      psoas abscesses complicating delivery.

TI  - [Streptococcus milleri subacute spinal cord abscess. Apropos of a case].
PG  - 100-4
AB  - Since 1830, more than eighty cases of spinal cord abscesses have been reported.
      In half of these cases, it was unfortunately a post-mortem diagnosis. Magnetic
      resonance imaging (MRI) now gives new possibilities in the diagnosis and
      treatment of this rare pathology. We report here a case of cervical spinal cord
      abscess due to Streptococcus milleri. The clinical and laboratory findings, the
      MRI features, the pathogenicity of the offending pathogen and the surgical
      approach are discussed and compared with the data from the literature. The
      functional course was unexpectedly favourable in this patient. MRI allows prompt 
      diagnosis and a precise localisation of the suspected abscess. Rapid surgical
      drainage is a critical prognostic factor for effective management of spinal cord 
      abscess.

TI  - Cervical discitis associated with spinal epidural abscess caused by
      methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus.
PG  - 40-4
AB  - A 53-year-old male developed fever, nuchalgia, shoulder pain, and sore throat
      after a partial sigmoidectomy. He suffered sudden onset of quadriplegia about 5
      days later. Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging indicated the characteristic
      appearance of C5-6 intervertebral disc herniation. However, anterior discectomy
      showed that he had cervical discitis associated with spinal epidural abscess.
      Continuous pus drainage from the abscess and vigorous antibiotic therapy were
      undertaken after surgery. He improved and could walk with assistance. MR imaging 
      with gadolinium can be useful in diagnosing pyogenic spinal infection (epidural
      abscess, osteomyelitis, and discitis), but care should be taken in MR image
      interpretation since spinal epidural abscess associated with discitis may mimic
      disc herniation. Axial MR images are important to distinguish this rare disease
      from other cervical disorders.

TI  - Primary vs secondary iliopsoas abscess. Presentation, microbiology, and
      treatment.
PG  - 1309-13
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To review the characteristics of patient presentation, microbiology,
      and treatment of primary iliopsoas abscess. DESIGN: A case series of patients
      with iliopsoas abscess diagnosed on computed tomographic scans from 1987 to 1994.
      SETTING: Tertiary care inner-city university hospital. PATIENTS: Eleven patients 
      with secondary iliopsoas abscess, defined as being secondary to gastrointestinal 
      or genitourinary causes or trauma, and seven patients with primary abscess,
      defined as the absence of the above causes. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Patient
      characteristics, presenting symptoms and signs, microbiologic characteristics,
      treatment, and clinical course of patients with primary iliopsoas abscesses
      compared with those in patients with secondary abscesses. RESULTS: In the primary
      group, six patients (86%) were intravenous drug users and four (57%) were
      positive for human immunodeficiency virus. Staphylococcus aureus grew from
      cultures from five of seven patients with primary abscesses, whereas secondary
      abscesses had enteric flora. The typical patient presentation included fever,
      with complaints of pain in the flank, hip, or abdomen. Comparison of abscess
      drainage options showed shorter hospitalizations for surgical drainage than for
      percutaneous drainage (15.9 vs 28.5 days; P < or = .01). CONCLUSIONS: A patient
      who presents with pain in the flank, hip, or abdomen may have a primary iliopsoas
      abscess. Computed tomography is the standard method of diagnosis. Antibiotic
      regimens for patients with primary iliopsoas abscess should include coverage for 
      S aureus, and patients with secondary abscesses should have antibiotic regimens
      tailored for enteric bacteria. Drainage of abscess is essential for appropriate
      treatment, and surgical drainage is superior to percutaneous drainage in
      achieving prompt recovery.

TI  - Pyogenic infectious spondylitis in children: the convergence of discitis and
      vertebral osteomyelitis.
PG  - 652-60
AB  - The outcomes of 47 patients, ranging in age from 7 months to 15 years, 8 months
      (average, 4 years, 8 months) with presumed pyogenic infectious spondylitis
      (so-called discitis) were evaluated retrospectively with regard to duration and
      recurrence of symptoms, and the need for readmission, retreatment, or surgical
      intervention. Among nonimmobilized patients, 18% (four of 22) receiving
      intravenous antibiotics, 50% (five of 10) receiving oral antibiotics, and 67%
      (four of six) receiving no antibiotics (analgesics and bed rest only) had either 
      prolonged or recurrent symptoms or both. Among patients treated with spinal
      immobilization, one of five receiving concomitant intravenous antibiotics and two
      of two receiving no antibiotics had a recurrence of symptoms following
      discontinuation of immobilization. Two patients required surgical drainage of
      paraspinal abscesses (one cervical and one lumbar). These findings support the
      contention that so-called discitis is simply pyogenic infectious spondylitis in
      children and suggest that specific treatment with intravenous antibiotics is more
      likely to lead to rapid relief of symptoms and signs without recurrence.

TI  - Pediatric spinal blastomycosis: case report.
PG  - 534-6
AB  - A 5-year-old male patient presented with flank pain, limping, weight loss, and
      cachexia. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed destructive vertebral changes, an
      epidural mass, psoas abscesses, and lack of involvement of the disc spaces.
      Blastomyces dermatitidis was isolated from a needle aspiration specimen. Sparing 
      of the disc spaces, an unusual finding, suggested that the spread of infection
      was by way of paravertebral structures and surrounding potential spaces.
      Management was simplified by using gadolinium contrast-enhanced magnetic
      resonance imaging, which indicated that the epidural mass was mainly solid,
      thereby obviating abscess drainage.

TI  - Pelvic abscess induced by a methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus from
      haematogenous spread via the CVP line in a burn patient.
PG  - 387-8
AB  - A 38-year-old female patients was found accidentally to have a positive culture
      of MRSA from a routine CVP catheter tip culture 1 week after she had complete
      wound closure. She was recovering from a partial skin thickness burn covering 42 
      per cent TBSA on the trunk and extremities. Fever and hip pain developed abruptly
      1 week later when she was ready for discharge from hospital. Magnetic resonance
      imaging (MRI) of the pelvis disclosed an intramuscular abscess. Open drainage was
      performed and pus culture yielded a MRSA with the same sensitivity profile as the
      previous CVP tip culture. Vancomycin 500 mg every 6 h was used for 3 weeks until 
      the drain culture disclosed a negative result, and a follow-up MRI indicated a
      loss of the abscess space. Follow-up at an outpatient clinic 3 months later
      showed that the patient remained symptom free. In this patient haematogenous
      dissemination was the most likely route of pelvic abscess formation. It should be
      remembered that MRSA infection is not always only a local problem, especially in 
      the immunocompromised condition of burn injury.

AB  - In a 72-year-old Dutchman Brucellae suis spondylodiscitis TXII-LI was diagnosed, 
      complicated by a paraspinal abscess, for which surgical drainage was carried out.
      The patient failed to recover after the combined antibiotic regimen of
      doxycycline, rifampicin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. There was good
      clinical improvement after a course of doxycycline and streptomycin, however.
      After a symptom-free period of 9 weeks a relapse occurred. The patient refused
      treatment and died 6 weeks later at home. The infection had probably been
      contracted after handling wild boar carcasses from eastern Europe.

TI  - [Tuberculosis of the spine in children. Personal experience].
PG  - 295-301
AB  - We are currently witnessing a worldwide return of tuberculosis. An extremely rare
      form is tuberculosis of the spine which is reported above all in extra-European
      studies. The authors report a case of Pott's disease in a child aged 3 years and 
      3 months who was referred to their attention due to the appearance of left
      inguinal swelling, fever and anemia. Diagnostic tests (ETG, CT, MR) showed an
      abscess involving the L5-S1 intersomatic space, the intervertebral disc and
      osteolytic lesions of S1, with impairment of the left psoas muscle and diffusion 
      as far as the inguinal region. Chemotherapy was commenced using isoniazid,
      ethambutol, rifampicin, and streptomycin and lasted 24 months associated with
      drainage of the ileopsoas abscess. Conservative orthopedic treatment lasting for 
      one year initially took the form of decubitus in bed with hyperdistension of the 
      vertebral column, followed by the creation of a plaster-cast cot on the back and 
      lastly a glass-reinforced resin orthopedic jacket. The follow-up of 2 years and

PG  - 201-4
AB  - Over a 4 years period, 87 cases of primary abscesses of the psoas were treated
      surgically at the Central Hospital in Yaounde. The psoas muscle was involved in
      10.17% of the cases with myositis. Most patients were in young male and the
      abscesses were in an advanced stage. Staphylococcus was the most frequently
      encountered germ (78.4%) and enterobacteria were only found in 3.07%. The
      diagnosis was based on clinical and echographic findings. There was 1 patient
      with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Most cases were treated by
      extraperitoneal drainage. Morbidity and mortality were low and generally occurred
      in debilitated patients (AIDS, involvement of several muscle groups, diabetes).

PG  - 124-6
AB  - The case of a 52-year-old patient with intrathoracic abscesses following a
      traumatic fracture of the 11th thoracic vertebral body is described. The
      abscesses were resistant to conventional antibiotic therapy and attempts at local
      drainage under CT scan control remained unsuccessful. Finally, chlamydia
      pneumoniae was isolated using an immunofluorescence technique. Subsequent therapy
      with doxycycline caused complete resolution of the abscesses. We suggest that in 
      cases of atypical pneumonias and abscesses, infection with chlamydia pneumoniae
      should be taken into consideration.

AB  - We present an analysis of the neurologic manifestations of Staphylococcus aureus 
      infections in 43 patients. Half of the infections whose source could be
      identified were nosocomial. The spectrum of neurological sequelae included
      meningitis, solitary and multiple intracerebral and epidural abscesses, cerebral 
      ischemia and hemorrhage, acute encephalopathies, subdural empyemas, spinal
      abscesses, and radicular compression syndromes. In the majority of patients the
      course was severe and protracted and relapses were frequent. Mortality was high
      (28%), even with early diagnosis and treatment; diabetes mellitus, alcohol abuse,
      and chronic renal failure were unfavorable prognostic factors. In patients with
      abscess formation early surgical drainage improved the outcome. However, often
      treatment was complicated by sequestration at inaccessible foci and secondary
      dissemination. Combined antibiotic therapy with flucloxacillin and
      chloramphenicol may be the most successful antibiotic regimen.

PG  - 235-8
AB  - We report the clinical, radiological and microbiological features of ten patients
      diagnosed of pyogenic sacroiliitis in an Internal Medicine Department during a 13
      years period. Clinical signs and radiological or scintigraphical findings were
      present in every case. Staphylococcus aureus was isolated in blood cultures in
      eight cases. We remark mean age (26.2 years), male predominance and the high
      prevalence of intravenous drug abuse as the main epidemiological data in our
      patients. Onset was acute in 60% of the cases, and subacute in the others.
      Erythrocyte sedimentation rate and a high white blood cell count were uniformly
      elevated among laboratory tests. Initial roentgenograms were normal in 60%. Bone 
      scans were the most sensitive diagnostic aid. All the patients were treated with 
      intravenous cloxacilin between two and eight weeks; aminoglycosides were added in
      four patients. We have observed two cases of psoas abscesses that required
      surgical drainage.

AB  - Osteomyelitis of the spine caused by Salmonella is rare. The authors describe a
      case in which the patient had fusion of the L1 and L2 vertebrae, which were
      affected by osteomyelitis. The infecting organism was Salmonella typhimurium. The
      authors describe the relationship of the vascular anatomy to the development of
      osteomyelitis of the spine. They discuss the clinical features, diagnosis,
      pathogenesis and treatment of the disease. Although the association of
      osteomyelitis due to Salmonella and sickle cell disease has long been known, this
      patient did not have sickle cell disease or any other condition that would
      compromise the immune system.

TI  - Percutaneous catheter drainage of tuberculous psoas abscesses.
PG  - 366-8
AB  - Six patients with 7 tuberculous psoas or ilio-psoas abscesses were treated by
      CT-guided catheter drainage and chemotherapy. The abscesses (5 unilateral and 1
      bilateral) were completely drained using a posterior or lateral approach. The
      abscess volume was 70 to 700 ml (mean 300 ml) and the duration of drainage 5 to
      11 days (mean 7 days). Immediate local symptomatic improvement was achieved in
      all patients, and there were no procedural complications. CT follow-up at 3 to 9 
      months showed normalization in 5 patients, 2 of whom are still on medical
      therapy. One patient, who did not take the medication regularly, had a recurrent 
      abscess requiring new catheter drainage after which the fluid collection
      disappeared. Percutaneous drainage represents an efficient and attractive
      alternative to surgical drainage as a supplement to medical therapy in the
      management of patients with large tuberculous psoas abscesses.

TI  - [Pyomyositis caused by Staphylococcus aureus].
PG  - 201-5
AB  - BACKGROUND: An evaluation of the clinical characteristics and profitability of
      the diagnostic methods of myositis by Staphylococcus aureus was undertaken in
      favor of earlier diagnosis and treatment. METHODS: Twenty-eight cases of
      pyomyositis by S. aureus attended over the last nine years were studied.
      Inclusion criteria were: 1) compatible clinical manifestations, 2) demonstration 
      of an abscess in CT and/or surgery, 3) isolation of S. aureus in abscess,
      hemoculture and/or neighboring tissue. RESULTS: Age: 36 +/- 18 years (limits
      9-70). Sex: 23 males (82%). Neighboring pathology existed in 11 cases (39%). 5
      sacroiliitis (18%), 4 spondyliodiscitis, 2 osteomyelitis. Favoring/predisposing
      factors: intravenous drug addiction in 11, staphylococcal sepsis in 6, diabetes
      mellitus in 4, previous surgery in 3, penetrating muscle injury in 3, and
      parametritis in 1. Fourteen cases (50%) corresponded to primary pyomyositis. The 
      muscle most frequently involved was the psoas/iliacpsoas, followed by near the
      forearm muscle, spinal, gluteal, and upper pectoral muscles. In 16 cases (57%),
      only one muscle was involved, in 10 two muscles, and in 2 three groups. The time 
      of clinical manifestation prior to consultation oscillated between 1.5-30 days,
      being less in cases of primary pyomyositis (p less than 0.0005). All the patients
      referred fever and local pain, with functional impotence in 26 (93%), general
      involvement, shivering and perspiration in 24 (86%). All the patients presented
      pain upon palpation. In 19 (68%) there was an increase in local temperature and
      in 18 a palpable mass. S. aureus was isolated in 16 hemocultures (sensitivity
      57%), in 12 of 13 cultures of neighboring tissue (92%) and in all those aspirated
      from abscesses (100%). CT demonstrated muscular (thickening and/or
      destructuration or abscess) and neighboring pathology (if existent) in all cases.
      All the patients received medical treatment. Evacuating puncture was carried out 
      in 7 cases, and surgical drainage in 23 (82%). Two cases were cured exclusively
      with medical treatment. Complications were seen in 8 cases (29%) and two patients
      died of staphylococcal sepsis. CONCLUSIONS: 1) In myositis by Staphylococcus
      aureus the percentage of primary pyomyositis is considerable. 2) In secondary
      pyomyositis the most frequent neighboring processes were sacroiliitis and
      spondylitis. 3) intravenous drug addiction was the most frequent predisposing
      factor. 4) The time of clinical evolution is variable although less in case of
      primary pyomyositis. 5) The performance of hemocultures was found to be greater
      than described and even greater in primary pyomyositis. 6) Abscess cultures and
      CT are the most efficient microbiological and imaging techniques in the early
      diagnosis of myositis by S. aureus.

PG  - 1483-6
AB  - A 57-yr-old man with a chronic lung cavity presumed to be related to ankylosing
      spondylitis and/or old cavitary tuberculosis presented with hemoptysis and
      rapidly developed lower extremity paresis and hypoesthesia. On chest radiograph
      he had a left upper lobe lesion suggestive of aspergilloma combined with a large 
      left empyema with bronchopleural fistula. Serologic analysis demonstrated
      precipitins and very high titer IgG antibodies to Aspergillus fumigatus antigens.
      Decompressive laminectomy from T1 to T5 was performed, with drainage of A.
      fumigatus culture-positive material from an epidural abscess compressing the
      spinal cord. Chest drainage was required for control of the empyema. With a total
      course of 3 g of intravenously administered amphotericin B, rehabilitative
      therapy, and chronic empyema drainage, he is now at home and ambulatory with
      assistance. He is also being followed by regular serum assays of IgG antibodies
      to Aspergillus proteins. We report the case of an apparent long-term survivor of 
      a formerly lethal and/or nonreversible paraplegic condition. The critical factors
      compared with previous cases with a poor outcome would appear to be prompt
      neurosurgical intervention, restoration of a normal number of T-cells, effective 
      long-term chest drainage, and high dose amphotericin treatment.

      literature.
PG  - 387-90
AB  - A 76-year-old male with chief complaints of back and right leg sciatica was
      hospitalized. His abdominal CT scan revealed lumber spondylitic stenosis. A
      laminectomy was performed. Postoperatively, he became febrile, aphasic and had
      grand mal seizure. A left craniotomy of the front abscess, seen in the CT scan,
      was performed. H and E stained smears of drainage revealed dematiaceous, septate 
      hyphae. Cultures of the abscess drainage grew an olivaceous-grey fungus. Based on
      macro- and micro-morphological characters, growth at 42 degrees C, and
      exoantigenic analysis, the patient's fungus was identified as Xylohypha bantiana.
      Treatment with amphotericin B and 5-fluorocytosine was initiated. Despite
      surgical procedures and antifungal therapy, the patient's condition deteriorated 
      and he died a few weeks later due to cerebral edema. The case reported here is
      the first microscopically, culturally, histopathologically and exoantigenically
      proven case of phaeohyphomycosis caused by X. bantiana in the province of Alberta
      and from Canada. A review of the literature on cases of X. bantiana infections
      has also been presented.

TI  - Nonoperative treatment of neurosurgical infections.
PG  - 359-73
AB  - The indications for nonsurgical management of CNS infections manifested by
      collections of pus are very limited. In general, such management is restricted to
      neurologically intact patients who are unable to undergo the needed surgical
      procedure and in whom the organism can be identified presumptively from other
      cultures. In such circumstances, brain abscesses less than 1.5 cm in diameter,
      small subdural empyemas, some spinal epidural abscesses, and many cases of spinal
      osteomyelitis can be successfully treated with prolonged intravenous antibiotic
      therapy. In patients who are unable to tolerate a neurosurgical procedure, the
      presence of an infectious CNS mass lesion is not hopeless and vigorous medical
      therapy offers the possibility of cure.

PG  - 701-5
AB  - The presentation and management of eight patients with pyogenic psoas abscesses
      treated at the National Naval Medical Center, Bethesda, Maryland, between January
      1986 and July 1989 are presented. The psoas abscesses were secondary to
      underlying gastrointestinal disease in six patients and sacral osteomyelitis in
      one patient. In one patient, the etiology of the abscess could not be determined.
      The average duration of symptoms in these patients was 16 days. Computed
      tomography was useful in identifying the abscess, defining its complexity, and
      planning therapy in all eight patients. Seven patients had complex,
      multiloculated abscesses, and one patient had a simple abscess. Extraperitoneal
      drainage was used in all patients. The patients with multiloculated abscesses had
      open surgical drainage, while the patient with the simple abscess had
      percutaneous catheter drainage. Most patients with a gastrointestinal etiology
      for their abscess underwent staged resection 3 to 6 weeks after the drainage
      procedure. There were no deaths, recurrent abscesses, or fistulae in these
      patients. Two patients developed thromboembolic complications postoperatively.
      Extraperitoneal drainage with staged resection of underlying gastrointestinal
      pathology is a safe and effective way of treating patients with psoas abscesses.

TI  - [Non-surgical treatment of spinal epidural abscesses: report of one case].
PG  - 325-9
AB  - Spinal epidural abscesses (SEA) are uncommon in children. This paper reported a
      two-year-old boy who was noted to have neck stiffness, with local tenderness
      posteriorly. Bacterial meningitis was suspected initially in terms of the finding
      of the cerebral spinal fluid; antibiotics were prescribed. Three days later
      another spinal tap was performed because of persistent high fever and
      irritability. A pus-like material drained out as the needle punctured into the
      spinal region. A magnetic resonance image (MRI) scan of the spine revealed a SEA,
      with extensive involvement from the second cervical spine to the lumbosacral
      spine region. Culture of the pus, as well as the blood and CSF, were positive for
      Staphylococcus aureus. Because of extensive involvement of the spinal epidural
      space, the patient was again given antibiotics: Prostaphllin and Amikin
      intravenously for six weeks instead of laminectomy. Then the oral antibiotic
      (Keflex) was given to the patient for another three months after the boy was
      discharged from the hospital. A review of the literature shows the incidence of
      SEA to be increasing and the bacterial spectra to be broadening because of
      increasing use of immunosuppressing drugs or antibiotics, and the increase in
      numbers of immunecompromised patient. The clinical symptoms and signs of the SEA 
      were non-specific, but SEA can be early diagnosed by computurized tomography (CT)
      scan or MRI scan with caution. The literature suggests that, if the patient's
      condition fits the criteria for non-surgical treatment, antibiotic therapy is the
      first choice for preventing the complication of spinal deformity, especially in
      children.

TI  - The skeletal manifestations of brucellosis.
PG  - 17-9
AB  - A prospective study of 33 patients with skeletal complications of brucellosis is 
      reported. The diagnosis depends on the brucellar agglutination titre because the 
      clinical, radiological and histological features are not specific, and blood
      culture and culture of synovial fluid are often negative. The commonest site is
      the sacroiliac joint, and brucellosis must be differentiated from tuberculosis as
      an important cause of backache. Treatment is with chemotherapy, the preferred
      combination being rifampicin and co-trimoxazole. Relapse can occur, but the
      chances can be reduced by careful clinical monitoring, and by repeated
      serological tests and gallium scanning; it is treated by further chemotherapy.
      Operation is indicated to relieve spinal cord compression or to drain a large
      paravertebral abscess.

      incidence of the disease in the tropics. Three young adults with pyomyositis have
      previously been described in Israel, two of them were newly arrived Ethiopian
      immigrants. We report three Israeli children with pyomyositis, who presented
      initially with nonspecific abdominal pain; in one child the course was
      complicated by spinal cord compression due to extension of the infected mass into
      the spinal canal. All three patients attained full recovery after antibiotic
      therapy and surgical drainage. Computed tomography was most valuable in
      establishing the diagnosis and defining the extent of the process.

PG  - 145-50
AB  - Nineteen patients were treated at the Los Angeles County Harbor/UCLA Medical
      Center between 1971 and 1986 for tuberculosis of the spine. Fourteen were
      immigrants, a high-risk group. A high index of suspicion is required for Pott's
      disease, which occurs in fewer than 1 percent of patients with tuberculosis,
      often presents with nonspecific symptoms, and may result in permanent deformity
      or neurologic impairment. CT scan, the most useful diagnostic test, showed
      abnormal results in 11 of 11 patients. MRI, a newer modality, may provide even
      more information. Eight patients required operation in addition to antimicrobial 
      therapy. Four had lesions between T3 and T10, where the spinal canal is narrow,
      of whom three (75 percent had neurologic involvement. All four underwent anterior
      approach (thoracotomy) for decompression, debridement, and spinal fusion. Fifteen
      had lesions between T11 and S2. Three (20 percent) had neurologic involvement but
      responded to medical treatment alone. Four underwent drainage of abscess or
      spinal fusion for deformity. Combined surgical and medical treatment gave
      excellent results in this series.

PG  - 1168-70
AB  - We report a case of spinal epidural abscess in a 42-year-old diabetic. The
      patient first presented with four days of low back pain with radicular symptoms
      following exertion. When he returned five days later with overt symptoms and
      signs of spinal cord compression, an epidural mass was diagnosed by myelogram and
      computed tomography scan. Following drainage of a large posterior epidural
      abscess, the patient was left with residual weakness requiring ongoing physical
      therapy.

TI  - Skeletal tuberculosis in New Zealand since the introduction of chemotherapy.
PG  - 727-32
AB  - The incidence of skeletal tuberculosis in New Zealand as measured by both
      hospital morbidity and notification data has fallen since the introduction of
      chemotherapy to low levels comparable with other developed societies. The decline
      has been greatest in the 5-14 year age group and least in the over 65 group.
      Individual surgeons can now expect to see few cases in a practising lifetime.
      Effective chemotherapy is the key to successful treatment. Adequate biopsy is
      essential, but apart from the drainage of large abscesses the place of surgery in
      the early management of osteoarticular tuberculosis is discretionary. Early
      activity can usually be encouraged once chemotherapy is instituted, late
      reconstruction by joint arthroplasty being available if adequate function is not 
      achieved.

      cases.
PG  - 1069-73
AB  - Pyogenic osteomyelitis rarely affects the first and second cervical vertebrae,
      and when it does it can progress to abscess formation, compressing the spinal
      cord. If the process is unrecognized, it can be fatal. The cases of five patients
      are reported. Two patients were treated by anterior debridement and posterior
      cervical-occipital arthrodesis; one, by transoral drainage; one, by posterior
      cervical-occipital arthrodesis; and the fifth, by posterior atlanto-axial
      arthrodesis. The causative organism was Staphylococcus aureus in four patients
      and Pasteurella multocida in one. In all patients, intravenous antibiotics were
      used, followed by prolonged administration of oral antibiotics. All five patients
      recovered.

TI  - Brucellar spondylitis: a detailed analysis based on current findings.
PG  - 656-64
AB  - Three hundred thirty-one cases of brucellosis included in a 10-year prospective
      protocol were reviewed to identify and follow up patients with spondylitis. Of 20
      patients (17 male and three female; mean age, 54 years), spondylitis was
      diagnosed soon after onset of the brucellosis in 15, there were significant
      systemic symptoms in 17, and blood cultures were positive for Brucella melitensis
      in 14. The main symptom was vertebral pain. The commonest radiographic changes
      were narrowing of the disk and epiphysitis. The discrete character of
      radiographic alterations and negative uptake on bone scanning caused diagnostic
      delays in three patients. 99mTc bone scans finally became abnormal in all
      patients, but were not useful for follow-up because low uptake persisted after
      the clinical status stabilized. Three patients had paravertebral abscesses; in
      two of them fever and pain persisted despite antibiotic therapy until diagnosis
      and surgical drainage. Finally, all patients were cured, ten with sequelae.
      Brucellar spondylitis often had an acute clinical course with bacteremia. Because
      neither clinical nor radiographic changes one year after onset were significant, 
      long-term follow-up is not considered necessary except when paravertebral abscess
      is suspected.

AB  - Hemophilus aphrophilus is an uncommon pathogen in man. It has rarely been
      reported as a cause of meningitis, exclusively in boys three years or younger.
      Osteomyelitis due to this organism is also rare. H. aphrophilus was responsible
      for meningitis, probable thoracic empyema, and ultimately vertebral osteomyelitis
      and suppurative psoas abscess formation in a woman following metrizamide
      myelography. The patient responded well to antibiotic treatment and surgical
      drainage. The organism was sensitive not only to chloramphenicol but also to
      newer cephalosporin antibiotics.

TI  - Pyogenic psoas abscesses: noninvasive diagnostic techniques and review of the
      literature.
PG  - 1003-11
AB  - Psoas muscle abscesses are a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge. Until
      recently, surgery was mandated for diagnosis and drainage of these deep posterior
      lesions. Scanning techniques such as computerized tomography, radionuclide
      imaging, and ultrasonography now enable noninvasive visualization of
      abnormalities of the psoas muscle. Patients with abscesses in the greater psoas
      muscle fall into two distinct groups. Six of 12 patients reviewed had no apparent
      predisposing conditions. These patients presented with subacute symptoms of
      fever, pain, and disability. Staphylococcus aureus was the predominant organism
      isolated. Psoas infections developed in six other patients secondarily to
      infection or trauma elsewhere in the abdomen. Gram-negative and enteric organisms
      were the predominant bacteria isolated from this group. Surgical drainage in
      selected patients and appropriate antimicrobial therapy is necessary for
      treatment of these infections. Late complications such as osteomyelitis are not
      unusual.

TI  - Spinal epidural abscesses. Surgical and parasurgical management.
PG  - 347-57
AB  - 42 cases of spinal epidural abscesses were operated on in the years 1957-1980,
      among approximately 8,000 spinal operations. Staphylococcus aureus was the
      microorganism most commonly isolated from infected material and the primary
      source of infection was in most cases cutaneous and/or subcutaneous lesions.
      Typical clinical history included back pain and fever, with progressive nerve
      root and spinal cord involvement. The cases were divided into three groups
      according to the operative findings: (a) acute abscesses; (b) chronic abscesses, 
      and (c) mixed or subacute abscesses. These three groups differed as to duration
      of illness, incidence of meningeal signs, white blood cell concentration and
      lumbar puncture results. Plain X-rays were positive in 20% of cases. Myelography,
      whose indications were maximally restricted, gave in some instances inaccurate
      results. Treatment consisted of extensive laminectomy of all the affected spinal 
      segments, and drainage of infected material. Local and systemic appropriate
      antibiotic therapy was also given. An average of 16 daily sessions of
      barotherapy, consisting of 1.7-2.0 atm given in 40-60 min, were administered in
      the last 9 cases. When compared with the patients to which barotherapy was not
      given, these cases showed a lower rate of permanent disability (11 vs. 21%), even
      if they were managed under less favorable clinical and neurological conditions.
      These results seem to support a favorable role of hyperbaric treatment in the
      management of spinal epidural abscesses. Early diagnosis and appropriate
      management remain essential in order to have satisfactory treatment results.

TI  - Pyomyositis tropicans: a diagnostic dilemma.
PG  - 512-3
AB  - Pyomyositis tropicans is a rare disease in non-tropical climates and thus
      presents diagnostic difficulties. Two children with single staphylococcal psoas
      muscle abscesses were recently successfully treated. Computerized axial
      tomography was found to be a useful diagnostic aid, allowing exact localization
      of the lesion. The diagnosis and therapy of these abscesses are discussed.

TI  - Intravenous metronidazole therapy for Bacteroides fragilis meningitis.
PG  - 494-7
AB  - A 69-year-old man developed meningitis due to Bacteroides fragilis and
      Streptococcus MG-intermedius, which progressed during chloramphenicol and
      nafcillin therapy to the extent that he seemed near death, with frank pus
      covering the spinal cord at surgery. Treatment with intravenous metronidazole and
      penicillin G was curative. After multiple trauma, a 20-year-old man developed
      meningitis due to Escherichia coli and B fragilis. He failed to respond to
      chloramphenicol alone, but responded to combined treatment with chloramphenicol
      and metronidazole. The right frontal sinus and epidural space abscesses were
      drained and a right frontal lobe abscess was excised. Metronidazole may be a
      uniquely effective agent for treatment of meningitis due to susceptible strains
      of Bacteroides fragilis.

AB  - Six children with abscess of the psoas muscle are presented. Previous trauma
      pain, claudication and antalgic position of a lower limb, fever, abdominal
      tenderness and leukocytosis were prominet features. Four patients improved and
      two died. Treatment included surgical drainage and antibiotics. Differential
      diagnosis and possible pathogenesis are discussed.
