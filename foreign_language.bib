  abstract={Objective: 
To investigate the effect of preoperative percutaneous drainage in lumbar tuberculosis with psoas abscess, through compare the clinical efficacy of two different methods.
Methods: 
Thirty-six patients with lumbar tuberculosis complicated with psoas abscess in corresponding with the inclusion criteria were admitted in Zhejiang Province Traditional Chinese Medicine Hospital from January 2015 to January 2017. The patients were divided into group A and group B according to the different therapeutic methods. All patients were given the standard anti tuberculosis treatment, and percutaneous catheter drainage was used in group A after admission immediately for psoas abscess before operation, while group B with no special treatment. At 3 weeks after anti tuberculosis treatment, 2 patients were excluded in group B, which had to postpone operation because of no reduction in erythrocyte sedimentation rate(ESR) and C reactive protein(CRP). Finally 34 patients were enrolled in this study. There were 18 cases in group A, including 10 males and 8 females, aged from 24 to 73 years old with an average of(42.5±10.2) years. There were 16 cases in group B, including 9 males and 7 females, aged from 23 to 75 years old with an average of(42.3±9.8) years. All patients were treated with posterior pedicle screw fixation, anterior debridement and bone graft fusion. Anterior surgery bleeding volume, operation time, anterior incision length, postoperative anus exhaust time, VAS score, Cobb angle, ESR, CRP changes and postoperative sinus formation were compared between two groups.
Results: 
All patients were followed up for 6 to 21 months with an average of 13 months. At the last follow-up, no mixed infection, tuberculosis recurrence, pedicle screw loosening and nail withdrawal were found. The average operative time, anterior surgery bleeding volume and anterior incision length of group A were less than that of group B(P<0.05). Postoperative anal exhaust time of group A was lower than that of group B(P<0.05). Improvement degree of ESR, CRP at 3 weeks after anti tuberculosis and 1 week after operation, group A was better than group B(P<0.05), and there was no significant difference between two groups in 1 month and 6 months after operation(P>0.05). There was 1 case sinus formation in group A and 5 cases in group B, there was significant difference in sinus formation rate between two groups (P<0.05). VAS score and Cobb angle at 1 month after operation was obvious improved(P<0.05), but there was no significant difference between two groups (P>0.05). Spinal cord nerve injury was obvious improved after operation, but there was no significant difference between two groups.
Conclusions: 
Preoperative percutaneous catheter drainage is a safe and feasible method for the treatment of lumbar tuberculosis with psoas abscess. It can increase the effect of anti tuberculosis before operation, reduce the surgical trauma and reduce the incidence of postoperative complications. It can be recommended in clinical application.},
